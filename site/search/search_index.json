XTerm is the standard terminal emulator application for the X Window System ( X.org ). Each XTerm window runs as a separate process. Some may run on remote machines, using the X protocol to display on a local machine, while others may run and display on the same local machine. X allows applications to update their windows independently, but the local machine's keyboard and mouse are shared, i.e., only delivering input events to the window which currently has focus . Why use it? Developed for the X Window System that is time-tested and available across Linux and UNIX systems. Packages available on most Linux and UNIX systems. Independent of the Linux desktop environment, so you can spend your training time to become a more advanced user of this one terminal emulator rather than having to learn yet another terminal emulator if you switch desktop environments. Configured in a simple config file that is portable across systems and desktop environments: Download, upload, and back up your configuration as a single file. Easy-to-read, single-line parameters and values. Easy-to-understand configuration steps for novice terminal users. One of the faster terminal emulators. Hundreds of community color themes , 256 color support for Text UI applications like Midnight Commander and htop , and easy color theme creation and editing. Supports Powerline . Supports Unicode. Provides DEC VT102/VT220 and implements most of the control sequences for VT220. Provides selected features from other higher-level DEC terminals (VTxxx) such as VT320, VT420, and VT520. Provides Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system directly. What does it mean? xterm is the name of a specific application and its command-line command. Its capitalized form is XTerm (which also corresponds to the X resource class name); similarly, uxterm is capitalized as UXTerm . The word XTerm is a combination of X (the X Window System) and Terminal (a terminal emulator), and is pronounced as \u02c8eks\u02cct\u0259rm . The word xterm might be erroneously misused by some to refer to any terminal emulator out there.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#xterm","text":"Developed and maintained since 1986.","title":"XTerm"},{"location":"#what-is-it","text":"XTerm is the standard terminal emulator application for the X Window System ( X.org ).

For desktop users, X resources are typically stored in the ~/.Xresources dotfile. (For additional details, see the section ~/.Xresources for advanced use cases further below.) The X resources that you can configure for XTerm are listed in the XTerm manpage, which is available as $ man xterm or online . To configure XTerm on a system, simply download or create and edit your ~/.Xresources dotfile, and then run the xrdb command to load the X resources from your ~/.Xresources dotfile. See the next sections for step-by-step instructions. Checking for the ~/.Xresources dotfile Before doing anything regarding the ~/.Xresources dotfile, first check if you already have it in the system's user home directory. Because ~/.Xdefaults and ~/.Xdefaults-* are other dotfiles where X resources might be stored, you can check for their presence too. Read the output of the command to find out: $ ls -a ~/.Xresources ~/.Xdefaults ~/.Xdefaults-* TIP The easiest way to start with a ~/.Xresources dotfile is to download and use the sample file (see instructions inside that file). Alternatively, you can run $ touch ~/.Xresources to create a blank one where you can add XTerm configuration lines. Checking the loaded X resources Run $ xrdb -query to view the loaded X resources. TIP This command might be useful after editing the ~/.Xresources dotfile. Loading the X resources from the ~/.Xresources dotfile Run $ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources . Updating the ~/.Xresources dotfile 1. Edit your ~/.Xresources dotfile, adding or removing XTerm parameters or changing their values. 2. Run $ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources to load the updated X resources. (If you get any error messages in the output, edit the ~/.Xresources file to resolve the errors.) 3. Open a new XTerm window by running $ xterm & to visually verify the changes in the window. ~/.Xresources for advanced use cases Referencing another file in ~/.Xresources You can reference another file in the ~/.Xresources dotfile with an absolute path, for example /home/<user>/... , not using the tilde ~ .

TIP XTerm's X resources enable you to configure how much of text you wish to get selected on multiple clicks, adjust the clicking speed (as time interval) for multiple clicks, include or exclude the new line, and more. For more information, see Configure and Customize copy and paste . With a mouse or trackball that has a scroll wheel, you can extend your initial selection beyond the visible screen in an XTerm window: 1. Make your initial selection by left-clicking and dragging to highlight text. 2. Scroll down (or up) to where you want to continue the started selection. 3. Right-click precisely on the line and column where you want to complete the selection. If the selection is very long, you can continue to scroll and right-click to extend the selection multiple times. NOTE Right-clicking means using mouse button 3, and scrolling works as described when XTerm is not using the mouse protocol. Copying text in XTerm By default, XTerm automatically copies every text selection you make in an XTerm window. You don't need to press any keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+C ) or go into any menu (like clicking a Copy button). XTerm has already copied the selected text. IMPORTANT Unconfigured XTerm copies text to the PRIMARY buffer rather than CLIPBOARD that most applications use nowadays. Unless you prefer or need to use the PRIMARY buffer on purpose, it's best that you configure XTerm to copy all text to CLIPBOARD instead. To do that, all you need to do is add the XTerm.vt100.selectToClipboard: true X resource to your dotfile (this is already true in sample.Xresources ). For more information, see Configure and Customize copy and paste . TIP You can configure XTerm to work with a keyboard shortcut to copy text if you can't get used to the convenience of not having to press any keys to copy. For how to set a custom keyboard shortcut, see Configure and Customize copy and paste . Pasting text in XTerm By default, to paste copied text into an XTerm window, use the Shift+Insert keyboard shortcut or the middle mouse button (if your mouse or trackpad has one). TIP Depending on your system, you should be able to use the Shift+Insert keyboard shortcut for pasting text copied from an XTerm window into other applications (like Ctrl+V ). If you stick with using the Shift+Insert keyboard shortcut in XTerm, it's easier to remember and more convenient to use this same shortcut every time you paste text copied to or from XTerm. TIP You can set a custom keyboard shortcut for pasting selected text. For how to do that, see Configure and Customize copy and paste . This is useful in some situations such as when the keyboard you're using doesn't have a dedicated Insert button, making it difficult to press Shift+Insert .
