# Themes

Under construction.

refer to the configuration procedure page

Too much work, but in theory the format for listing themes could be:
```
----
= theme n+1
* screenshot
* link to the sample Xresources file for HD-15-inch laptops that incorporates this theme
* link to the file containing only this theme (to be added into Xresources)
----
```
