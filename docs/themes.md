# Themes

This page is under construction.

XTerm themes are color schemes that affect the foreground and background colors of the content displayed within the XTerm window.

You can create any custom color scheme you want as your personal theme, although it is easier and time-saving to just take and use one of the plentitude of the readily available themes, which you can also customize to your personal taste.

This content is currently available in the [files.Xresources repository on GitHub](https://github.com/xterm-x11/files.Xresources/tree/main/themes).
