# XTerm

*Developed and maintained since 1986.*

## What is it?

XTerm is the standard terminal emulator application for the X Window System ([X.org](https://x.org/)).

Each XTerm window runs as a separate process. Some may run on remote machines, using the X protocol to display on a local machine, while others may run and display on the same local machine. X allows applications to update their windows independently, but the local machine's keyboard and mouse are shared, i.e., only delivering input events to the window which currently has *focus*.

## Why use it?

* Developed for the X Window System that is time-tested and available across Linux and UNIX systems.
* Packages available on most Linux and UNIX systems.
* Independent of the Linux desktop environment, so you can spend your training time to become a more advanced user of this one terminal emulator rather than having to learn yet another terminal emulator if you switch desktop environments.
* Configured in a simple config file that is portable across systems and desktop environments: Download, upload, and back up your configuration as a single file. Easy-to-read, single-line parameters and values. Easy-to-understand configuration steps for novice terminal users.
* One of the faster terminal emulators.
* [Hundreds of community color themes](https://github.com/xterm-x11/files.Xresources/tree/main/XTerm-color-theme-registry), with 256 color support and easy color theme creation.
* Supports [Powerline](https://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html).
* Supports Unicode.
* Provides DEC VT102/VT220 and implements most of the control sequences for VT220.
* Provides selected features from other higher-level DEC terminals (VTxxx) such as VT320, VT420, and VT520.
* Provides Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system directly.

## What does it mean?

*xterm* is the name of a specific application and its command-line command. Its capitalized form is *XTerm* (which also corresponds to the X resource class name); similarly, *uxterm* is capitalized as *UXTerm*. The word *XTerm* is a combination of *X* (the X Window System) and *Terminal* (a terminal emulator), and is pronounced as *ˈeksˌtərm*. The word *xterm* might be erroneously misused by some to refer to any terminal emulator out there.
