<h1>Configuring XTerm</h1>
<p>Almost all of XTerm's configuration is described in terms of X resources (see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/X_resources">archlinux.org</a> and <a href="https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/doc/ixresources/xres.html">stuff.mit.edu</a>). For desktop users, X resources are typically stored in the <code>~/.Xresources</code> dotfile. (For additional details, see the section <em>~/.Xresources for advanced use cases</em> further below.)</p>
<p>The X resources that you can configure for XTerm are listed in the XTerm manpage, which is available as <code>$ man xterm</code> or <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/manpage/xterm.html#h2-RESOURCES">online</a>.</p>
<!-- Update the above par when the template file is completed:
The X resources that you can configure for XTerm are listed in the [template](https://github.com/xterm-x11/files.Xresources/blob/main/template.Xresources) file and in the XTerm manpage, which is available as `$ man xterm` or [online](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/manpage/xterm.html#h2-RESOURCES).
-->

<p>To configure XTerm on a system, simply download or create and edit your <code>~/.Xresources</code> dotfile, and then run the <code>xrdb</code> command to load the X resources from your <code>~/.Xresources</code> dotfile. See the next sections for step-by-step instructions.</p>
<h2>Checking for the ~/.Xresources dotfile</h2>
<p>Before doing anything regarding the <code>~/.Xresources</code> dotfile, first check if you already have it in the system's user home directory. Because <code>~/.Xdefaults</code> and <code>~/.Xdefaults-*</code> are other dotfiles where X resources might be stored, you can check for their presence too. Read the output of the command to find out:</p>
<p><code>$ ls -a ~/.Xresources ~/.Xdefaults ~/.Xdefaults-*</code></p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong> The easiest way to start with a <code>~/.Xresources</code> dotfile is to download and use the <a href="https://github.com/xterm-x11/files.Xresources/blob/main/sample.Xresources">sample</a> file (see instructions inside that file). Alternatively, you can run <code>$ touch ~/.Xresources</code> to create a blank one where you can add XTerm configuration lines.</p>
<h2>Checking the loaded X resources</h2>
<p>Run <code>$ xrdb -query</code> to view the loaded X resources.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong> This command might be useful after editing the <code>~/.Xresources</code> dotfile.</p>
<h2>Loading the X resources from the ~/.Xresources dotfile</h2>
<p>Run <code>$ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources</code>.</p>
<h2>Updating the ~/.Xresources dotfile</h2>
<p>1. Edit your <code>~/.Xresources</code> dotfile, adding or removing XTerm parameters or changing their values.</p>
<p>2. Run <code>$ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources</code> to load the updated X resources. (If you get any error messages in the output, edit the <code>~/.Xresources</code> file to resolve the errors.)</p>
<p>3. Open a new XTerm window by running <code>$ xterm &amp;</code> to visually verify the changes in the window.</p>
<h2>~/.Xresources for advanced use cases</h2>
<h3>Referencing another file in <code>~/.Xresources</code></h3>
<p>You can reference another file in the <code>~/.Xresources</code> dotfile with an absolute path, for example <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;/...</code>, not using the tilde <code>~</code>. This means you can load XTerm's X resources from another file by adding the following statement on a line in <code>~/.Xresources</code>:</p>
<p><code>#include "/&lt;absolute_path_to_file&gt;/&lt;file_with_x_resources_for_xterm&gt;"</code></p>
<h3>Differences between <code>.Xresources</code> and <code>.Xdefaults</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>.Xresources</code> are loaded into the X server, so are linked to a particular display environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>"For most desktop environments, ~/.Xresources should be loaded at login.  Note that if you make changes, you will need to run xrdb to pick them up. In my case, typically I care more about the server than the client for things like font size: for example, when using my laptop the resources are configured to suit a 14" screen at a particular resolution, and those same settings are used when I run xvile either locally, or remotely on my workstation over ssh.  When sitting at my workstation which has a somewhat larger screen, I want different settings configured in the X server.  By using .Xresources rather than .Xdefaults the same invocation of xvile behaves appropriately depending on where it is being displayed, rather than where was invoked from." <a href="https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/vile/2019-11/msg00002.html"><em>Source</em></a> "<code>.Xresources</code> works using <code>ssh -x</code>. I thought that my window manager would automatically load <code>.Xresources</code>, but it doesn't do so.  Modifying my <code>.xinitrc</code> fixes the problem." <a href="https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/vile/2019-11/msg00004.html"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<ul>
<li><code>.Xdefaults</code> are set based on the client.</li>
</ul>
<h3>.Xdefaults-<em>host</em> and XENVIRONMENT</h3>
<p>"On POSIX-based systems, the user's environment resource file name is specified by the value of the <code>XENVIRONMENT</code> Environment Variable. If this environment variable does not exist, the user's home directory is searched for a file named <code>.Xdefaults-&lt;host&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;host&gt;</code> is the host name of the machine on which the application is running." <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/libXt/intrinsics.html"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<h3>XAPPLRESDIR</h3>
<p>Another in-depth alternative is to set <code>XAPPLRESDIR</code>, which lets one set up a directory where X will search for an <code>.Xresources</code> dotfile:</p>
<p><code>application-specific files
               Directories named by the environment variable  XUSERFILESEARCH‐
               PATH  or  the  environment  variable XAPPLRESDIR (which names a
               single directory and should end with a '/' on  POSIX  systems),
               plus   directories   in   a   standard   place  (usually  under
               /usr/share/X11/, but this can be  overridden  with  the  XFILE‐
               SEARCHPATH  environment variable) are searched for for applica‐
               tion-specific  resources.   For  example,  application  default
               resources  are  usually  kept  in /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/.
               See the X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language Interface manual  for
               details.</code>

<p><a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/libXt/intrinsics.html"><em>X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language Interface</em></a> discusses this as well.</p>
<h2>Additional resources</h2>
<p>Run <code>$ xrdb -help</code> or see the <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/xrdb.1.xhtml">xrdb</a> manpage for more <code>xrdb</code> options.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> If you decide to use <code>$ xrdb -remove</code>, be aware that it clears <strong>(!)</strong> <em>all</em> previously loaded X resources, including the X resources that were loaded at system startup.</p>
