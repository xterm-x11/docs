<h2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION" id="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<pre>       The <i>xterm</i> program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It
       provides DEC VT102/VT220 and selected features from higher-level
       terminals such as VT320/VT420/VT520 (VT<i>xxx</i>).  It also provides
       Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system
       directly.  If the underlying operating system supports terminal
       resizing capabilities (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems
       derived from 4.3BSD), <i>xterm</i> will use the facilities to notify programs
       running in the window whenever it is resized.

       The VT<i>xxx</i> and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their own window so
       that you can edit text in one and look at graphics in the other at the
       same time.  To maintain the correct aspect ratio (height/width),
       Tektronix graphics will be restricted to the largest box with a 4014's
       aspect ratio that will fit in the window.  This box is located in the
       upper left area of the window.

       Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is
       considered the "active" window for receiving keyboard input and
       terminal output.  This is the window that contains the text cursor.
       The active window can be chosen through escape sequences, the <b><a href="#h3-VT-Options">VT</a></b>
       <b><a href="#h3-VT-Options">Options</a></b> menu in the VT<i>xxx</i> window, and the <b><a href="#h3-Tek-Options">Tek Options</a></b> menu in the 4014
       window.

<h2><a name="h2-EMULATIONS" id="h2-EMULATIONS">EMULATIONS</a></h2>
<pre>       <i>Xterm</i> provides usable emulations of related DEC terminals:

       <b>o</b>   VT52 emulation is complete.

       <b>o</b>   VT102 emulation is fairly complete, but does not support autorepeat
           (because that would affect the keyboard used by other X clients).

           Double-size characters are displayed properly if your font server
           supports scalable bitmap fonts.

       <b>o</b>   VT220 emulation does not support soft fonts, it is otherwise
           complete.

       <b>o</b>   VT420 emulation (the default) supports controls for manipulating
           rectangles of characters as well as left/right margins.

           <i>Xterm</i> does not support some other features which are not suitable
           for emulation, e.g., two-sessions.

       Terminal database (<i>terminfo</i> (5) or <i>termcap</i> (5)) entries that work with
       <i>xterm</i> include

              an optional platform-specific entry ("xterm-new"),
              "xterm",
              "vt102",
              "vt100",
              "ansi" and
              "dumb"

       <i>Xterm</i> automatically searches the terminal database in this order for
       these entries and then sets the "TERM" variable (and the "TERMCAP"
       environment variable on a few older systems).  The alternatives after
       "xterm" are very old, from the late 1980s.

       VT100 and VT102 emulations are commonly equated, though they actually
       differ.  The VT102 provided controls for inserting and deleting lines.

       Similarly, "ansi" and "vt100" are often equated.  These are not really
       the same.  For instance, they use different controls for scrolling (but
       <i>xterm</i> supports both).  These features differ in an "ansi" terminal
       description from <i>xterm</i>:

       <b><a title="EMULATIONS:acsc" name="EMULATIONS:acsc">acsc</a></b>
               Pseudo-graphics (line-drawing) uses a different mapping.

       <b><a title="EMULATIONS:xenl" name="EMULATIONS:xenl">xenl</a></b>
               <i>Xterm</i> wraps text at the right margin using the VT100 "newline
               glitch" behavior.

       Because of the wrapping behavior, you would occasionally have to
       repaint the screen when using a text editor with the "ansi"
       description.

       You may also use descriptions corresponding to the various supported
       emulations such as "vt220" or  "vt420", but should set the terminal
       emulation level with the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:decTerminalID">decTerminalID</a></b> resource.

       On most systems, <i>xterm</i> will use the terminfo database.  Some older
       systems use termcap.  (The "TERMCAP" environment variable is not set if
       <i>xterm</i> is linked against a terminfo library, since the requisite
       information is not provided by the termcap emulation of terminfo
       libraries).

       Many of the special <i>xterm</i> features may be modified under program
       control through a set of escape sequences different from the standard
       VT<i>xxx</i> escape sequences (see <i>Xterm Control Sequences</i>).

       The Tektronix 4014 emulation is also fairly good.  It supports 12-bit
       graphics addressing, scaled to the window size.  Four different font
       sizes and five different lines types are supported.  There is no write-
       through or defocused mode support.  The Tektronix text and graphics
       commands are recorded internally by <i>xterm</i> and may be written to a file
       by sending the COPY escape sequence (or through the <b>Tektronix</b> menu; see
       below).  The name of the file will be

           "COPY<i>yyyy</i>-<i>MM</i>-<i>dd</i>.<i>hh</i>:<i>mm</i>:<i>ss</i>"

       where <i>yyyy</i>, <i>MM</i>, <i>dd</i>, <i>hh</i>, <i>mm</i> and <i>ss</i> are the year, month, day, hour,
       minute and second when the COPY was performed (the file is created in
       the directory <i>xterm</i> is started in, or the home directory for a login
       <i>xterm</i>).

       Not all of the features described in this manual are necessarily
       available in this version of <i>xterm</i>.  Some (e.g., the non-VT220
       extensions) are available only if they were compiled in, though the
       most commonly-used are in the default configuration.

</pre>
<h2><a name="h2-OTHER-FEATURES" id="h2-OTHER-FEATURES">OTHER FEATURES</a></h2>
<pre>       <i>Xterm</i> automatically highlights the text cursor when the pointer enters
       the window (selected) and unhighlights it when the pointer leaves the
       window (unselected).  If the window is the focus window, then the text
       cursor is highlighted no matter where the pointer is.

       In VT<i>xxx</i> mode, there are escape sequences to activate and deactivate an
       alternate screen buffer, which is the same size as the display area of
       the window.  When activated, the current screen is saved and replaced
       with the alternate screen.  Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the
       window is disabled until the normal screen is restored.  The usual
       terminal description for <i>xterm</i> allows the visual editor <b><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/vi.html">vi(1)</a></b> to switch
       to the alternate screen for editing and to restore the screen on exit.
       A popup menu entry makes it simple to switch between the normal and
       alternate screens for cut and paste.

       In either VT<i>xxx</i> or Tektronix mode, there are escape sequences to change
       the name of the windows.  Additionally, in VT<i>xxx</i> mode, <i>xterm</i> implements
       the window-manipulation control sequences from <i>dtterm</i>, such as resizing
       the window, setting its location on the screen.

       <i>Xterm</i> allows character-based applications to receive mouse events
       (currently button-press and release events, and button-motion events)
       as keyboard control sequences.  See <i>Xterm Control Sequences</i> for
       details.

</pre>
<h2><a name="h2-OPTIONS" id="h2-OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h2>
<pre>       Because <i>xterm</i> uses the <i>X Toolkit</i> library, it accepts the standard <i>X</i>
       <i>Toolkit</i> command line options.  <i>Xterm</i> also accepts many application-
       specific options.

       By convention, if an option begins with a "<b>+</b>" instead of a "<b>-</b>", the
       option is restored to its default value.

       Most of the <i>xterm</i> options are actually parsed by the <i>X Toolkit</i>, which
       sets resource values, and overrides corresponding resource-settings in
       your X resource files.  <i>Xterm</i> provides the <i>X Toolkit</i> with a table of
       options.  A few of these are marked, telling the <i>X Toolkit</i> to ignore
       them (<b><a href="#OPTIONS:-help">-help</a></b>, <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-version">-version</a></b>, <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-class">-class</a></b>, <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-e">-e</a></b>, and <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-into">-into</a></b>).  After the <i>X Toolkit</i> has
       parsed the command-line parameters, it removes those which it handles,
       leaving the specially-marked parameters for <i>xterm</i> to handle.

       These options do not set a resource value, and are handled specially:

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-version" name="OPTIONS:-version">-version</a></b>
               This causes <i>xterm</i> to print a version number to the standard
               output, and then exit.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-help" name="OPTIONS:-help">-help</a></b>   This causes <i>xterm</i> to print out a verbose message describing its
               options, one per line.  The message is written to the standard
               output.  After printing the message, <i>xterm</i> exits.  <i>Xterm</i>
               generates this message, sorting it and noting whether a
               "<b>-</b><i>option</i>" or a "<b>+</b><i>option</i>" turns the feature on or off, since
               some features historically have been one or the other.  <i>Xterm</i>
               generates a concise help message (multiple options per line)
               when an unknown option is used, e.g.,

                   xterm -z

               If the logic for a particular option such as logging is not
               compiled into <i>xterm</i>, the help text for that option also is not
               displayed by the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-help">-help</a></b> option.

       The <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-version">-version</a></b> and <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-help">-help</a></b> options are interpreted even if <i>xterm</i> cannot
       open the display, and are useful for testing and configuration scripts.
       Along with <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-class">-class</a></b>, they are checked before other options.  To do this,
       <i>xterm</i> has its own (much simpler) argument parser, along with a table of
       the <i>X Toolkit</i>'s built-in list of options.

       Relying upon the <i>X Toolkit</i> to parse the options and associated values
       has the advantages of simplicity and good integration with the X
       resource mechanism.  There are a few drawbacks

       <b>o</b>   <i>Xterm</i> cannot tell easily whether a resource value was set by one of
           the external resource- or application-defaults files, whether it
           was set using <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/xrdb.1.xhtml"><b>xrdb(1)</b></a>, or if it was set through the <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-xrm">-xrm</a></b> option or
           via some directly relevant command-line option.  <i>Xterm</i> sees only
           the end-result: a value supplied when creating its widgets.

       <b>o</b>   <i>Xterm</i> does not know the order in which particular options and items
           in resource files are evaluated.  Rather, it sees all of the values
           for a given widget at the same time.  In the design of these
           options, some are deemed more important, and can override other
           options.

           The <i>X Toolkit</i> uses patterns (constants and wildcards) to match
           resources.  Once a particular pattern has been used, it will not
           modify it.  To override a given setting, a more-specific pattern
           must be used, e.g., replacing "*" with ".".  Some poorly-designed
           resource files are too specific to allow the command-line options
           to affect the relevant widget values.

       <b>o</b>   In a few cases, the <i>X Toolkit</i> combines its standard options in ways
           which do not work well with <i>xterm</i>.  This happens with the color
           (<b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-fg">-fg</a></b>, <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-bg">-bg</a></b>) and reverse (<b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-rv">-rv</a></b>) options.  <i>Xterm</i> makes a special case
           of these and adjusts its sense of "reverse" to lessen user
           surprise.

       One parameter (after all options) may be given.  That overrides <i>xterm</i>'s
       built-in choice of shell program:

       <b>o</b>   If the parameter is not a relative path, i.e., beginning with "./"
           or "../", <i>xterm</i> looks for the file in the user's PATH.  In either
           case, this check fails if <i>xterm</i> cannot construct an absolute path.

       <b>o</b>   If that check fails (or if no such parameter is given), <i>xterm</i> next
           checks the "SHELL" variable.  If that specifies an executable file,
           <i>xterm</i> will attempt to start that.  However, <i>xterm</i> additionally
           checks if it is a valid shell, and will unset "SHELL" if it is not.

       <b>o</b>   If "SHELL" is not set to an executable file, <i>xterm</i> tries to use the
           shell program specified in the user's password file entry.  As
           before, <i>xterm</i> verifies if this is a valid shell.

       <b>o</b>   Finally, if the password file entry does not specify a valid shell,
           <i>xterm</i> uses <i>/bin/sh</i>.

       The <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-e">-e</a></b> option cannot be used with this parameter since it uses all
       parameters following the option.

       <i>Xterm</i> validates shell programs by finding their pathname in the text
       file <b>/etc/shells</b>.  It treats the environment variable "SHELL" specially
       because (like "TERM"), <i>xterm</i> both reads and updates the variable, and
       because the program started by <i>xterm</i> is not necessarily a shell.

       The other options are used to control the appearance and behavior.  Not
       all options are necessarily configured into your copy of <i>xterm</i>:

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-132" name="OPTIONS:-132">-132</a></b>    Normally, the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence that switches
               between 80 and 132 column mode is ignored.  This option causes
               the DECCOLM escape sequence to be recognized, and the <i>xterm</i>
               window will resize appropriately.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-ah" name="OPTIONS:-ah">-ah</a></b>     This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should always highlight the
               text cursor.  By default, <i>xterm</i> will display a hollow text
               cursor whenever the focus is lost or the pointer leaves the
               window.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+ah" name="OPTIONS:_ah">+ah</a></b>     This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should do text cursor
               highlighting based on focus.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-ai" name="OPTIONS:-ai">-ai</a></b>     This option disables active icon support if that feature was
               compiled into <i>xterm</i>.  This is equivalent to setting the <i>vt100</i>
               resource <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:activeIcon">activeIcon</a></b> to "false".

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+ai" name="OPTIONS:_ai">+ai</a></b>     This option enables active icon support if that feature was
               compiled into <i>xterm</i>.  This is equivalent to setting the <i>vt100</i>
               resource <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:activeIcon">activeIcon</a></b> to "true".

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-aw" name="OPTIONS:-aw">-aw</a></b>     This option indicates that auto-wraparound should be allowed,
               and is equivalent to setting the <i>vt100</i> resource <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:autoWrap">autoWrap</a></b> to
               "true".

               Auto-wraparound allows the cursor to automatically wrap to the
               beginning of the next line when it is at the rightmost position
               of a line and text is output.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+aw" name="OPTIONS:_aw">+aw</a></b>     This option indicates that auto-wraparound should not be
               allowed, and is equivalent to setting the <i>vt100</i> resource
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:autoWrap">autoWrap</a></b> to "false".

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-b" name="OPTIONS:-b">-b</a></b> <i>number</i>
               This option specifies the size of the inner border (the
               distance between the outer edge of the characters and the
               window border) in pixels.  That is the <i>vt100</i> <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:internalBorder">internalBorder</a></b>
               resource.  The default is "2".

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-barc" name="OPTIONS:-barc">-barc</a></b>   This option, corresponding to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBar">cursorBar</a></b> resource, makes the
               cursor a bar instead of a box.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+barc" name="OPTIONS:_barc">+barc</a></b>   This option, corresponding to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBar">cursorBar</a></b> resource, makes the
               cursor a box instead of a bar.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-baudrate" name="OPTIONS:-baudrate">-baudrate</a></b> <i>number</i>
               Set the line-speed, used to test the behavior of applications
               that use the line-speed when optimizing their output to the
               screen.  The default is "38400".

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-bc" name="OPTIONS:-bc">-bc</a></b>     turn on text cursor blinking.  This overrides the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlink">cursorBlink</a></b>
               resource.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+bc" name="OPTIONS:_bc">+bc</a></b>     turn off text cursor blinking.  This overrides the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlink">cursorBlink</a></b>
               resource.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-bcf" name="OPTIONS:-bcf">-bcf</a></b> <i>milliseconds</i>
               set the amount of time text cursor is off when blinking via the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorOffTime">cursorOffTime</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-bcn" name="OPTIONS:-bcn">-bcn</a></b> <i>milliseconds</i>
               set the amount of time text cursor is on when blinking via the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorOnTime">cursorOnTime</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-bdc" name="OPTIONS:-bdc">-bdc</a></b>    Set the <i>vt100</i> resource <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:colorBDMode">colorBDMode</a></b> to "false", disabling the
               display of characters with bold attribute as color.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+bdc" name="OPTIONS:_bdc">+bdc</a></b>    Set the <i>vt100</i> resource <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:colorBDMode">colorBDMode</a></b> to "true", enabling the
               display of characters with bold attribute as color rather than
               bold.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-cb" name="OPTIONS:-cb">-cb</a></b>     Set the <i>vt100</i> resource <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cutToBeginningOfLine">cutToBeginningOfLine</a></b> to "false".

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+cb" name="OPTIONS:_cb">+cb</a></b>     Set the <i>vt100</i> resource <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cutToBeginningOfLine">cutToBeginningOfLine</a></b> to "true".

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-cc" name="OPTIONS:-cc">-cc</a></b> <i>characterclassrange</i><b>:</b><i>value</i><b>[,</b> <b>...]</b>
               This sets classes indicated by the given ranges for using in
               selecting by words (see <b><a href="#h2-CHARACTER-CLASSES">CHARACTER CLASSES</a></b> and the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:charClass">charClass</a></b>
               resource).

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-cjk_width" name="OPTIONS:-cjk_width">-cjk_width</a></b>
               Set the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cjkWidth">cjkWidth</a></b> resource to "true".  When turned on,
               characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A) category in UTR 11
               have a column width of 2.  Otherwise, they have a column width
               of 1.  This may be useful for some legacy CJK text terminal-
               based programs assuming box drawings and others to have a
               column width of 2.  It also should be turned on when you
               specify a TrueType CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace) font
               either with <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-fa">-fa</a></b> at the command line or <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> resource.  The

               Some versions of <i>xterm</i> may have logging enabled.  However,
               normally logging is not supported, due to security concerns in
               the early 1990s.  That was a problem in X11R4 <b>xterm</b> (1989)
               which was addressed by a patch to X11R5 late in 1993.  X11R6
               included these fixes.  The older version (when running with
               <i>root</i> privilege) would create the log file using <i>root</i> privilege.
               The reason why <i>xterm</i> ran with <i>root</i> privileges was to open
               pseudo-terminals.  Those privileges are now needed only on very

               <b>o</b>   Otherwise a filename is generated, and the log file is
                   written to the directory from which <i>xterm</i> is invoked.

               <b>o</b>   The generated filename is of the form

                       XtermLog.<i>XXXXXX</i>

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-lc" name="OPTIONS:-lc">-lc</a></b>     Turn on support of various encodings according to the users'
               locale setting, i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment
               variables.  This is achieved by turning on UTF-8 mode and by
               invoking <i>luit</i> for conversion between locale encodings and
               UTF-8.  (<i>luit</i> is not invoked in UTF-8 locales.)  This

               The actual list of encodings which are supported is determined
               by <i>luit</i>.  Consult the <i>luit</i> manual page for further details.

               See also the discussion of the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-u8">-u8</a></b> option which supports UTF-8

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-leftbar" name="OPTIONS:-leftbar">-leftbar</a></b>
               Force scrollbar to the left side of VT100 screen.  This is the
               default, unless you have set the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:rightScrollBar">rightScrollBar</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-lf" name="OPTIONS:-lf">-lf</a></b> <i>filename</i>
               Specify the log filename.  This sets the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:logFile">logFile</a></b> resource.  If
               set to "-", <i>xterm</i> writes its log to the standard output.  See
               the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-l">-l</a></b> option.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-ls" name="OPTIONS:-ls">-ls</a></b>     This option indicates that the shell that is started in the
               <i>xterm</i> window will be a login shell (i.e., the first character
               of argv[0] will be a dash, indicating to the shell that it
               should read the user's .login or .profile).

               The <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-ls">-ls</a></b> flag and the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:loginShell">loginShell</a></b> resource are ignored if <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-e">-e</a></b> is
               also given, because <i>xterm</i> does not know how to make the shell
               start the given command after whatever it does when it is a
               login shell - the user's shell of choice need not be a Bourne
               shell after all.  Also, <i>xterm -e</i> is supposed to provide a
               consistent functionality for other applications that need to
               start text-mode programs in a window, and if <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:loginShell">loginShell</a></b> were
               not ignored, the result of ~/.profile might interfere with
               that.

               If you do want the effect of <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-ls">-ls</a></b> and <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-e">-e</a></b> simultaneously, you may
               get away with something like

                   xterm -e /bin/bash -l -c "my command here"

               Finally, <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-ls">-ls</a></b> is not completely ignored, because <i>xterm -ls -e</i>
               does write a <i>wtmp</i> entry (if configured to do so), whereas
               <i>xterm -e</i> does not.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+ls" name="OPTIONS:_ls">+ls</a></b>     This option indicates that the shell that is started should not
               be a login shell (i.e., it will be a normal "subshell").

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-maximized" name="OPTIONS:-maximized">-maximized</a></b>
               This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should ask the window manager
               to maximize its layout on startup.  This corresponds to the
               <b><a href="#Application-Resources:maximized">maximized</a></b> resource.

               Maximizing is not the reverse of iconifying; it is possible to

               Set the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:mkWidth">mkWidth</a></b> resource to "true".  This makes <i>xterm</i> use a
               built-in version of the wide-character width calculation.  The

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-s" name="OPTIONS:-s">-s</a></b>      This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> may scroll asynchronously,
               meaning that the screen does not have to be kept completely up
               to date while scrolling.  This allows <i>xterm</i> to run faster when
               network latencies are very high and is typically useful when
               running across a very large internet or many gateways.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+s" name="OPTIONS:_s">+s</a></b>      This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should scroll synchronously.

               Does not send title and icon name change requests when the
               request would have no effect: the name is not changed.  This
               has the advantage of preventing flicker and the disadvantage of
               requiring an extra round trip to the server to find out the
               previous value.  In practice this should never be a problem.

               type is not found, <i>xterm</i> uses the built-in list "xterm",
               "vt102", etc.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-u8" name="OPTIONS:-u8">-u8</a></b>     This option sets the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b> resource.  When <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b> is set, <i>xterm</i>
               interprets incoming data as UTF-8.  This sets the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:wideChars">wideChars</a></b>
               resource as a side-effect, but the UTF-8 mode set by this
               option prevents it from being turned off.  If you must turn
               UTF-8 encoding on and off, use the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-wc">-wc</a></b> option or the
               corresponding <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:wideChars">wideChars</a></b> resource, rather than the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-u8">-u8</a></b> option.

               This option and the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b> resource are overridden by the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-lc">-lc</a></b> and
               <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-en">-en</a></b> options and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:locale">locale</a></b> resource.  That is, if <i>xterm</i> has been
               compiled to support <i>luit</i>, and the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:locale">locale</a></b> resource is not
               "false" this option is ignored.  We recommend using the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-lc">-lc</a></b>
               option or the "<b>locale:</b> <b>true</b>" resource in UTF-8 locales when
               your operating system supports locale, or <b>-en UTF-8</b> option or
               the "<b>locale:</b> <b>UTF-8</b>" resource when your operating system does
               not support locale.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+u8" name="OPTIONS:_u8">+u8</a></b>     This option resets the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-uc" name="OPTIONS:-uc">-uc</a></b>     This option, corresponding to the <b>cursorUnderline</b> resource,
               makes the cursor underlined instead of a box.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+uc" name="OPTIONS:_uc">+uc</a></b>     This option m, corresponding to the <b>cursorUnderline</b> resource,
               akes the cursor a box instead of underlined.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-ulc" name="OPTIONS:-ulc">-ulc</a></b>    This option disables the display of characters with underline
               attribute as color rather than with underlining.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+ulc" name="OPTIONS:_ulc">+ulc</a></b>    This option enables the display of characters with underline
               attribute as color rather than with underlining.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-ulit" name="OPTIONS:-ulit">-ulit</a></b>   This option, corresponding to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:italicULMode">italicULMode</a></b> resource,
               disables the display of characters with underline attribute as
               italics rather than with underlining.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+ulit" name="OPTIONS:_ulit">+ulit</a></b>   This option, corresponding to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:italicULMode">italicULMode</a></b> resource,
               enables the display of characters with underline attribute as
               italics rather than with underlining.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-ut" name="OPTIONS:-ut">-ut</a></b>     This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should not write a record into
               the system <i>utmp</i> log file.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+ut" name="OPTIONS:_ut">+ut</a></b>     This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should write a record into the
               system <i>utmp</i> log file.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-vb" name="OPTIONS:-vb">-vb</a></b>     This option indicates that a visual bell is preferred over an
               audible one.  Instead of ringing the terminal bell whenever a
               Control-G is received, the window will be flashed.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+vb" name="OPTIONS:_vb">+vb</a></b>     This option indicates that a visual bell should not be used.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-wc" name="OPTIONS:-wc">-wc</a></b>     This option sets the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:wideChars">wideChars</a></b> resource.

               When <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:wideChars">wideChars</a></b> is set, <i>xterm</i> maintains internal structures for
               16-bit characters.  If <i>xterm</i> is not started in UTF-8 mode (or
               if this resource is not set), initially it maintains those
               structures to support 8-bit characters.  <i>Xterm</i> can later be
               switched, using a menu entry or control sequence, causing it to
               reallocate those structures to support 16-bit characters.

               The default is "false".

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+wc" name="OPTIONS:_wc">+wc</a></b>     This option resets the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:wideChars">wideChars</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-wf" name="OPTIONS:-wf">-wf</a></b>     This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should wait for the window to
               be mapped the first time before starting the subprocess so that
               the initial terminal size settings and environment variables
               are correct.  It is the application's responsibility to catch
               subsequent terminal size changes.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:+wf" name="OPTIONS:_wf">+wf</a></b>     This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should not wait before
               starting the subprocess.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-ziconbeep" name="OPTIONS:-ziconbeep">-ziconbeep</a></b> <i>percent</i>
               Same as <b><a href="#Application-Resources:zIconBeep">zIconBeep</a></b> resource.  If percent is non-zero, xterms
               that produce output while iconified will cause an XBell sound
               at the given volume and have "***" prepended to their icon
               titles.  Most window managers will detect this change
               immediately, showing you which window has the output.  (A
               similar feature was in x10 <i>xterm</i>.)

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-C" name="OPTIONS:-C">-C</a></b>      This option indicates that this window should receive console
               output.  This is not supported on all systems.  To obtain
               console output, you must be the owner of the console device,
               and you must have read and write permission for it.  If you are
               running X under <i>xdm</i> on the console screen you may need to have
               the session startup and reset programs explicitly change the
               ownership of the console device in order to get this option to
               work.

       <b><a title="OPTIONS:-S" name="OPTIONS:-S">-S</a></b><i>ccn</i>   This option allows <i>xterm</i> to be used as an input and output
               channel for an existing program and is sometimes used in
               specialized applications.  The option value specifies the last
               few letters of the name of a pseudo-terminal to use in slave
               mode, plus the number of the inherited file descriptor.  If the
               option contains a "/" character, that delimits the characters
               used for the pseudo-terminal name from the file descriptor.
               Otherwise, exactly two characters are used from the option for
               the pseudo-terminal name, the remainder is the file descriptor.
               Examples (the first two are equivalent since the descriptor
               follows the last "/"):

                   -S/dev/pts/123/45
                   -S123/45
                   -Sab34

               Note that <i>xterm</i> does not close any file descriptor which it did
               not open for its own use.  It is possible (though probably not
               portable) to have an application which passes an open file
               descriptor down to <i>xterm</i> past the initialization or the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-S">-S</a></b>
               option to a process running in the <i>xterm</i>.

<h3><a name="h3-Old-Options" id="h3-Old-Options">Old Options</a></h3>
<pre>       The following command line arguments are provided for compatibility
       with older versions.  They may not be supported in the next release as
       the <i>X Toolkit</i> provides standard options that accomplish the same task.

       <a title="Old Options:%" name="Old-Options:percent."><b>%</b><i>geom</i></a>   This option specifies the preferred size and position of the
               Tektronix window.  It is shorthand for specifying the
               "<b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:tekGeometry">tekGeometry</a></b>" resource.

       <a title="Old Options:#" name="Old-Options:pound."><b>#</b><i>geom</i></a>   This option specifies the preferred position of the icon
               window.  It is shorthand for specifying the "<b><a href="#Application-Resources:iconGeometry">iconGeometry</a></b>"
               resource.

       <b><a title="Old Options:-T" name="Old-Options:-T">-T</a></b> <i>string</i>
               This option specifies the title for <i>xterm</i>'s windows.  It is
               equivalent to <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-title">-title</a></b>.

       <b><a title="Old Options:-n" name="Old-Options:-n">-n</a></b> <i>string</i>
               This option specifies the icon name for <i>xterm</i>'s windows.  It is
               shorthand for specifying the "<b><a href="#Application-Resources:iconName">iconName</a></b>" resource.  Note that
               this is not the same as the <i>X Toolkit</i> option <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-name">-name</a></b>.  The
               default icon name is the application name.

               If no suitable icon is found, <i>xterm</i> provides a compiled-in
               pixmap.

               <i>X Toolkit</i> sets the <b><a href="#Properties-set-by-X-Toolkit:WM_ICON_NAME">WM_ICON_NAME</a></b> property using this value.

       <b><a title="Old Options:-r" name="Old-Options:-r">-r</a></b>      This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by
               swapping the foreground and background colors.  It is
               equivalent to <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-rv">-rv</a></b>.

       <b><a title="Old Options:-w" name="Old-Options:-w">-w</a></b> <i>number</i>
               This option specifies the width in pixels of the border
               surrounding the window.  It is equivalent to <b>-borderwidth</b> or
               <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-bw">-bw</a></b>.

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-X-Toolkit-Options" id="h3-X-Toolkit-Options">X Toolkit Options</a></h3>
<pre>       The following standard <i>X Toolkit</i> command line arguments are commonly
       used with <i>xterm</i>:

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-bd" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-bd">-bd</a></b> <i>color</i>
               This option specifies the color to use for the border of the
               window.  The corresponding resource name is <b>borderColor</b>.  <i>Xterm</i>
               uses the <i>X Toolkit</i> default, which is "XtDefaultForeground".

               <i>Xterm</i>'s VT100 window has two borders: the <i>inner</i> border
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:internalBorder">internalBorder</a></b> and the <i>outer</i> border <b>borderWidth</b>, managed by the
               <i>X Toolkit</i>.

               Normally <i>xterm</i> fills the inner border using the VT100 window's
               background color.  If the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:colorInnerBorder">colorInnerBorder</a></b> resource is enabled,
               then <i>xterm</i> may fill the inner border using the <b>borderColor</b>
               resource.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-bg" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-bg">-bg</a></b> <i>color</i>
               This option specifies the color to use for the background of
               the window.  The corresponding resource name is <i>background</i>.
               The default is "XtDefaultBackground".

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-bw" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-bw">-bw</a></b> <i>number</i>
               This option specifies the width in pixels of the border
               surrounding the window.

               This appears to be a legacy of older X releases.  It sets the
               <b>borderWidth</b> resource of the shell widget, and may provide
               advice to your window manager to set the thickness of the
               window frame.  Most window managers do not use this
               information.  See the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-b">-b</a></b> option, which controls the inner
               border of the <i>xterm</i> window.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-display" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-display">-display</a></b> <i>display</i>
               This option specifies the X server to contact; see <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man7/X.7.xhtml"><b>X(7)</b></a>.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-fg" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-fg">-fg</a></b> <i>color</i>
               This option specifies the color to use for displaying text.
               The corresponding resource name is <i>foreground</i>.  The default is
               "XtDefaultForeground".

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-fn" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-fn">-fn</a></b> <i>font</i>
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying normal
               text.  The corresponding resource name is <i>font</i>.  The resource
               value default is <i>fixed</i>.

               <i>Xterm</i>'s <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-fn">-fn</a></b> option accepts a comma-separated list like <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-fa">-fa</a></b>, for
               the VT100 widget, using the first bitmap font (and discarding
               additional fonts).  However, other widgets (such as the
               toolbar) will be confused by this and give a warning.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-font" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-font">-font</a></b> <i>font</i>
               This is the same as <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-fn">-fn</a></b>.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-geometry" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-geometry">-geometry</a></b> <i>geometry</i>
               This option specifies the preferred size and position of the
               VT<i>xxx</i> window; see <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man7/X.7.xhtml"><b>X(7)</b></a>.

               The normal geometry specification can be suffixed with <b>@</b>
               followed by a Xinerama screen specification; it can be either <b>g</b>
               for the global screen (default), <b>c</b> for the current screen or a
               screen number.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-iconic" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-iconic">-iconic</a></b>
               This option indicates that <i>xterm</i> should ask the window manager
               to start it as an icon rather than as the normal window.  The
               corresponding resource name is <i>iconic</i>.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-name" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-name">-name</a></b> <i>name</i>
               This option specifies the application name under which
               resources are to be obtained, rather than the default
               executable file name.  <i>Name</i> should not contain "." or "*"
               characters.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-rv" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-rv">-rv</a></b>     This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by
               swapping the foreground and background colors.  The
               corresponding resource name is <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:reverseVideo">reverseVideo</a></b>.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:+rv" name="X-Toolkit-Options:_rv">+rv</a></b>     Disable the simulation of reverse video by swapping foreground
               and background colors.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-title" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-title">-title</a></b> <i>string</i>
               This option specifies the window title string, which may be
               displayed by window managers if the user so chooses.  It is
               shorthand for specifying the "<b><a href="#Application-Resources:title">title</a></b>" resource.  The default
               title is the command line specified after the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-e">-e</a></b> option, if
               any, otherwise the application name.

               <i>X Toolkit</i> sets the <b><a href="#Properties-set-by-X-Toolkit:WM_NAME">WM_NAME</a></b> property using this value.

       <b><a title="X Toolkit Options:-xrm" name="X-Toolkit-Options:-xrm">-xrm</a></b> <i>resourcestring</i>
               This option specifies a resource string to be used.  This is
               especially useful for setting resources that do not have
               separate command line options.

       <i>X Toolkit</i> accepts alternate names for a few of these options, e.g.,

       <b>o</b>   "<b>-background</b>" for "<b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-bg">-bg</a></b>"

       <b>o</b>   "<b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-font">-font</a></b>" for "<b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-fn">-fn</a></b>"

       <b>o</b>   "<b>-foreground</b>" for "<b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-fg">-fg</a></b>"

       Abbreviated options also are supported, e.g., "<b>-v</b>" for "<b><a href="#OPTIONS:-version">-version</a></b>."

</pre>
<h2><a name="h2-RESOURCES" id="h2-RESOURCES">RESOURCES</a></h2>
<pre>       <i>Xterm</i> understands all of the core <i>X Toolkit</i> resource names and classes.
       It also uses the <i>X Toolkit</i> resource types (such as booleans, colors,
       fonts, integers, and strings) along with their respective converters.
       Those resource types are not always sufficient:

       <b>o</b>   <i>Xterm</i>'s resource values may be lists of names.  <i>X Toolkit</i> resource
           types do not include lists.  <i>Xterm</i> uses a string for the resource,
           and parses it.

           Comma-separated lists of names ignore case.

       <b>o</b>   <i>Xterm</i> may defer processing a resource until it is needed.  For
           example, <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:font2">font2</a></b> through <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:font7">font7</a></b> are loaded as needed, to start faster.
           Again, the actual resource type is a string, parsed and used when
           needed.

       Application specific resources (e.g., "<b>XTerm.</b><i>NAME</i>") follow:

               together by setting the DECBKM state according to whether the
               <i>initial erase</i> character is a backspace (8) or delete (127)
               character.  A "false" value disables this feature.  The default

               <b>o</b>   <i>stty</i> erase character (^H for backspace, ^? for delete)

               will affect DECBKM.  First, <i>xterm</i> obtains the initial <i>erase</i>
               character:

               <b>o</b>   <i>xterm</i>'s internal value is ^H

               <b>o</b>   <i>xterm</i> asks the operating system for the value which <b>stty</b>

               <b>PIE     stty   termcap</b>   <i>erase</i>
               -------------------------------
               false    ^H      ^H       ^H

               true     ^?      ^?       ^?

               Using that <i>erase</i> character, <i>xterm</i> allows further choices:

               <b>o</b>   if <b><a href="#Application-Resources:backarrowKeyIsErase">backarrowKeyIsErase</a></b> is true, <i>xterm</i> uses the <i>erase</i>
                   character for the initial state of <b>DECBKM</b>

               <b>o</b>   if <b><a href="#Application-Resources:backarrowKeyIsErase">backarrowKeyIsErase</a></b> is false, <i>xterm</i> sets <b>DECBKM</b> to 2
                   (internal).  This ties together <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:backarrowKey">backarrowKey</a></b> and the
                   control sequence for <b>DECBKM</b>.

               <b>o</b>   applications can send a control sequence to set/reset
                   <b>DECBKM</b> control set

               <b>o</b>   the "Backarrow Key (BS/DEL)" menu entry toggles <b>DECBKM</b>

       <b><a title="Application Resources:buffered" name="Application-Resources:buffered">buffered</a></b> (class <b>Buffered</b>)
               Normally <i>xterm</i> is built with double-buffer support.  This
               resource can be used to turn it on or off.  Setting the
               resource to "true" turns double-buffering on.  The default
               value is "False".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:bufferedFPS" name="Application-Resources:bufferedFPS">bufferedFPS</a></b> (class <b>BufferedFPS</b>)
               When <i>xterm</i> is built with double-buffer support, this gives the
               maximum number of frames/second.  The default is "40" and is
               limited to the range 1 through 100.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:cursorTheme" name="Application-Resources:cursorTheme">cursorTheme</a></b> (class <b>CursorTheme</b>)
               The <a href="/xterm/xcursor/xcursor.html"><b>Xcursor(7)</b></a> library provides a way to change the pointer
               shape and size.  The X11 library uses this library to extend
               the font- and glyph-cursor calls used by applications such as
               <i>xterm</i>  to substitute external files for the built-in "core"
               cursors provided by X.

               <i>Xterm</i> uses the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:pointerShape">pointerShape</a></b> resource to select the X cursor
               shape.  Most of the available sets of cursor themes provide an
               incomplete set of "core" cursors (while possibly adding other
               cursors).  Because of this limitation, <i>xterm</i> disables the
               feature by default.

               The cursor theme feature can be useful because X cursors are
               not scalable and on a high-resolution display, the cursors are
               hard to find.  Some of the cursor themes include larger cursors
               to work around this limitation:

               <b>o</b>   The default core cursors are 8x8 pixels;

               <b>o</b>   Some cursor themes include cursors up to the X server limit
                   of 64x64 pixels.

               At startup, <i>xterm</i> sets the <b>XCURSOR_THEME</b> environment variable
               to enable or disable the cursor theme feature.  The default
               value is "none".  Other values (including "default") are passed
               to the Xcursor library to select a cursor theme.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:fullscreen" name="Application-Resources:fullscreen">fullscreen</a></b> (class <b>Fullscreen</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should ask the window manager to
               use a fullscreen layout on startup.  <i>Xterm</i> accepts either a
               keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  Fullscreen layout is not used initially, but may be later
                  via menu-selection or control sequence.

               true (1)
                  Fullscreen layout is used initially, but may be disabled
                  later via menu-selection or control sequence.

               always (2)
                  Fullscreen layout is used initially, and cannot be disabled
                  later via menu-selection or control sequence.

               never (3)
                  Fullscreen layout is not used, and cannot be enabled later
                  via menu-selection or control sequence.

               The default is "false".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:hold" name="Application-Resources:hold">hold</a></b> (class <b>Hold</b>)
               If true, <i>xterm</i> will not immediately destroy its window when the
               shell command completes.  It will wait until you use the window
               manager to destroy/kill the window, or if you use the menu
               entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.  You may scroll
               back, select text, etc., to perform most graphical operations.
               Resizing the display will lose data, however, since this
               involves interaction with the shell which is no longer running.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:hpFunctionKeys" name="Application-Resources:hpFunctionKeys">hpFunctionKeys</a></b> (class <b>HpFunctionKeys</b>)
               Specifies whether or not HP function key escape codes should be
               generated for function keys.  The default is "false", i.e.,
               this feature is disabled.

               The <b><a href="#Application-Resources:keyboardType">keyboardType</a></b> resource is the preferred mechanism for
               selecting this mode.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:iconGeometry" name="Application-Resources:iconGeometry">iconGeometry</a></b> (class <b>IconGeometry</b>)
               Specifies the preferred size and position of the application
               when iconified.  It is not necessarily obeyed by all window
               managers.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:iconHint" name="Application-Resources:iconHint">iconHint</a></b> (class <b>IconHint</b>)
               Specifies an icon which will be added to the window manager
               hints.  <i>Xterm</i> provides no default value.

               Set this resource to "none" to omit the hint entirely, using
               whatever the window manager may decide.

               If the <b><a href="#Application-Resources:iconHint">iconHint</a></b> resource is given (or is set via the <b><a href="#Old-Options:-n">-n</a></b> option)
               <i>xterm</i> searches for a pixmap file with that name, in the current
               directory as well as in /usr/share/pixmaps.  if the resource
               does not specify an absolute pathname.  In each case, <i>xterm</i>
               adds "_48x48" and/or ".xpm" to the filename after trying
               without those suffixes.  If it is able to load the file, <i>xterm</i>
               sets the window manager hint for the icon-pixmap.  These
               pixmaps are distributed with <i>xterm</i>, and can optionally be
               compiled-in:

               <b>o</b>   mini.xterm_16x16, mini.xterm_32x32, mini.xterm_48x48

               <b>o</b>   filled-xterm_16x16, filled-xterm_32x32, filled-xterm_48x48

               <b>o</b>   xterm_16x16, xterm_32x32, xterm_48x48

               <b>o</b>   xterm-color_16x16, xterm-color_32x32, xterm-color_48x48

               In either case, <i>xterm</i> allows for adding a "_48x48" to specify
               the largest of the pixmaps as a default.  That is, "mini.xterm"
               is the same as "mini.xterm_48x48".

               If no explicit <b><a href="#Application-Resources:iconHint">iconHint</a></b> resource is given (or if none of the
               compiled-in names matches), <i>xterm</i> uses "mini.xterm" (which is
               always compiled-in).

               The <b><a href="#Application-Resources:iconHint">iconHint</a></b> resource has no effect on "desktop" files,
               including "panel" and "menu".  Those are typically set via a
               ".desktop" file; <i>xterm</i> provides samples for itself (and the
               <i>uxterm</i> script).  The more capable desktop systems allow
               changing the icon on a per-user basis.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:iconName" name="Application-Resources:iconName">iconName</a></b> (class <b>IconName</b>)
               Specifies a label for <i>xterm</i> when iconified.  <i>Xterm</i> provides no
               default value; some window managers may assume the application
               name, e.g., "xterm".

               Setting the <b><a href="#Application-Resources:iconName">iconName</a></b> resource sets the icon label unless
               overridden by <b><a href="#Application-Resources:zIconBeep">zIconBeep</a></b> or the control sequences which change
               the window and icon labels.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:keyboardType" name="Application-Resources:keyboardType">keyboardType</a></b> (class <b>KeyboardType</b>)
               Enables one (or none) of the various keyboard-type resources:
               <b><a href="#Application-Resources:hpFunctionKeys">hpFunctionKeys</a></b>, <b><a href="#Application-Resources:scoFunctionKeys">scoFunctionKeys</a></b>, <b><a href="#Application-Resources:sunFunctionKeys">sunFunctionKeys</a></b>,
               <b><a href="#Application-Resources:tcapFunctionKeys">tcapFunctionKeys</a></b>, <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:oldXtermFKeys">oldXtermFKeys</a></b> and <b><a href="#Application-Resources:sunKeyboard">sunKeyboard</a></b>.

               The resource's value should be one of the corresponding strings
               "hp", "sco", "sun", "tcap", "legacy" or "vt220", respectively.

               The individual resources are provided for legacy support; this
               resource is simpler to use.  <i>Xterm</i> will use only one keyboard-
               type, but if multiple resources are set, it warns and uses the
               last one it checks.

               The default is "unknown", i.e., none of the associated
               resources are set via this resource.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:maxBufSize" name="Application-Resources:maxBufSize">maxBufSize</a></b> (class <b>MaxBufSize</b>)
               Specify the maximum size of the input buffer.  The default is
               "32768".  You cannot set this to a value less than the
               <b><a href="#Application-Resources:minBufSize">minBufSize</a></b> resource.  It will be increased as needed to make
               that value evenly divide this one.

               On some systems you may want to increase one or both of the
               <b><a href="#Application-Resources:maxBufSize">maxBufSize</a></b> and <b><a href="#Application-Resources:minBufSize">minBufSize</a></b> resource values to achieve better
               performance if the operating system prefers larger buffer
               sizes.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:maximized" name="Application-Resources:maximized">maximized</a></b> (class <b>Maximized</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should ask the window manager to
               maximize its layout on startup.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:menuHeight" name="Application-Resources:menuHeight">menuHeight</a></b> (class <b>MenuHeight</b>)
               Specifies the height of the toolbar, which may be increased by
               the <i>X Toolkit</i> Layout widget depending upon the fontsize used.
               The default is "25".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:menuLocale" name="Application-Resources:menuLocale">menuLocale</a></b> (class <b>MenuLocale</b>)
               Specify the locale used for character-set computations when
               loading the popup menus.  Use this to improve initialization
               performance of the <i>Athena</i> popup menus, which may load
               unnecessary (and very large) fonts, e.g., in a locale having
               UTF-8 encoding.  The default is "C" (POSIX).

               To use the current locale (only useful if you have localized
               the resource settings for the menu entries), set the resource
               to an empty string.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:messages" name="Application-Resources:messages">messages</a></b> (class <b>Messages</b>)
               Specifies whether write access to the terminal is allowed
               initially.  See <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mesg&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=SunOS+4.1.3&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html"><b>mesg(1)</b></a>.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:minBufSize" name="Application-Resources:minBufSize">minBufSize</a></b> (class <b>MinBufSize</b>)
               Specify the minimum size of the input buffer, i.e., the amount
               of data that <i>xterm</i> requests on each read.  The default is
               "4096".  You cannot set this to a value less than 64.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:omitTranslation" name="Application-Resources:omitTranslation">omitTranslation</a></b> (class <b>OmitTranslation</b>)
               Selectively omit one or more parts of <i>xterm</i>'s default
               translations at startup.  The resource value is a comma-
               separated list of keywords, which may be abbreviated:

               default
                      ignore (mouse) button-down events which were not handled
                      by other translations

               fullscreen
                      assigns a key-binding to the <b><a href="#Application-Resources:fullscreen">fullscreen</a></b><b>()</b> action.

               keypress
                      assigns keypresses by default to the <b><a href="#Actions:insert-seven-bit">insert-seven-bit</a></b><b>()</b>
                      and <b><a href="#Actions:insert-eight-bit">insert-eight-bit</a></b><b>()</b> actions.

               paging assigns key bindings to the <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-back">scroll-back</a></b><b>()</b> and
                      <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-forw">scroll-forw</a></b><b>()</b> actions.

               pointer
                      assigns pointer <i>motion</i> and <i>button</i> events to the
                      <b><a href="#Actions:pointer-motion">pointer-motion</a></b><b>()</b> and <b><a href="#Actions:pointer-button">pointer-button</a></b><b>()</b> actions
                      respectively.

               popup-menu
                      assigns mouse-buttons with the <i>control</i> modifier to the
                      popup-menus.

               reset  assigns mouse-button 2 with the <i>meta</i> modifier to the
                      <b><a href="#Actions:clear-saved-lines">clear-saved-lines</a></b> action.

               scroll-lock
                      assigns a key-binding to the <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-lock">scroll-lock</a></b><b>()</b> action.

               select assigns mouse- and keypress-combinations to actions
                      which manipulate the selection.

                      <i>Xterm</i> also uses these actions to capture mouse button
                      and motion events which can be manipulated with the
                      mouse protocol control sequences.  If the <i>select</i>
                      translations are omitted, then the <b><a href="#Actions:pointer-motion">pointer-motion</a></b> and
                      <b><a href="#Actions:pointer-button">pointer-button</a></b> handle these mouse protocol control
                      sequences instead.

               shift-fonts
                      assigns key-bindings to <b><a href="#Actions:larger-vt-font">larger-vt-font</a></b><b>()</b> and
                      <b><a href="#Actions:smaller-vt-font">smaller-vt-font</a></b><b>()</b> actions.

               wheel-mouse
                      assigns buttons 4 and 5 with different modifiers to the
                      <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-back">scroll-back</a></b><b>()</b> and <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-forw">scroll-forw</a></b><b>()</b> actions.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:ptyHandshake" name="Application-Resources:ptyHandshake">ptyHandshake</a></b> (class <b>PtyHandshake</b>)
               If "true", <i>xterm</i> will perform handshaking during initialization
               to ensure that the parent and child processes update the <i>utmp</i>
               and <b><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/stty.html">stty(1)</a></b> state.

               See also <b><a href="#Application-Resources:waitForMap">waitForMap</a></b> which waits for the pseudo-terminal's
               notion of the screen size, and <b><a href="#Application-Resources:ptySttySize">ptySttySize</a></b> which resets the
               screen size after other terminal initialization is complete.
               The default is "true".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:ptyInitialErase" name="Application-Resources:ptyInitialErase">ptyInitialErase</a></b> (class <b>PtyInitialErase</b>)
               If "true", <i>xterm</i> will use the pseudo-terminal's sense of the
               <i>stty</i> erase value.  If "false", <i>xterm</i> will set the <i>stty</i> erase
               value to match its own configuration, using the <b>kb</b> string from
               the termcap entry as a reference, if available.

               In either case, the result is applied to the TERMCAP variable
               which <i>xterm</i> sets, if the system uses TERMCAP.

               See also the <b><a href="#Application-Resources:ttyModes">ttyModes</a></b> resource, which may override this.  The
               default is "False".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:ptySttySize" name="Application-Resources:ptySttySize">ptySttySize</a></b> (class <b>PtySttySize</b>)
               If "true", <i>xterm</i> will reset the screen size after terminal
               initialization is complete.  This is needed for some systems
               whose pseudo-terminals cannot propagate terminal
               characteristics.  Where it is not needed, it can interfere with
               other methods for setting the initial screen size, e.g., via
               window manager interaction.

               See also <b><a href="#Application-Resources:waitForMap">waitForMap</a></b> which waits for a handshake-message giving
               the pseudo-terminal's notion of the screen size.  The default
               is "false" on Linux and macOS systems, "true" otherwise.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:reportColors" name="Application-Resources:reportColors">reportColors</a></b> (class <b>ReportColors</b>)
               If true, <i>xterm</i> will print to the standard output a summary of
               colors as it allocates them.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:reportFonts" name="Application-Resources:reportFonts">reportFonts</a></b> (class <b>ReportFonts</b>)
               If true, <i>xterm</i> will print to the standard output a summary of
               each font's metrics (size, number of glyphs, etc.), as it loads
               them.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:reportIcons" name="Application-Resources:reportIcons">reportIcons</a></b> (class <b>ReportIcons</b>)
               If true, <i>xterm</i> will print to the standard output a summary of
               each pixmap icon as it loads them.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:reportXRes" name="Application-Resources:reportXRes">reportXRes</a></b> (class <b>ReportXRes</b>)
               If true, <i>xterm</i> will print to the standard output a list of the
               boolean, numeric and string X resources for the VT100 widget
               after initialization.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:sameName" name="Application-Resources:sameName">sameName</a></b> (class <b>SameName</b>)
               If the value of this resource is "true", <i>xterm</i> does not send
               title and icon name change requests when the request would have
               no effect: the name is not changed.  This has the advantage of
               preventing flicker and the disadvantage of requiring an extra
               round trip to the server to find out the previous value.  In
               practice this should never be a problem.  The default is
               "true".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:scaleHeight" name="Application-Resources:scaleHeight">scaleHeight</a></b> (class <b>ScaleHeight</b>)
               Scale line-height values by the resource value, which is
               limited to "0.9" to "1.5".  The default value is "1.0",

               While this resource applies to either bitmap or TrueType fonts,
               its main purpose is to help work around incompatible changes in
               the Xft library's font metrics.  <i>Xterm</i> checks the font metrics
               to find what the library claims are the bounding boxes for each
               glyph (character).  However, some of Xft's features (such as
               the autohinter) can cause the glyphs to be scaled larger than
               the bounding boxes, and be partly overwritten by the next row.

               <i>Xterm</i> translates certain key symbols based on its assumptions
               about your keyboard.  This resource specifies whether or not
               Sun/PC keyboard layout (i.e., the PC keyboard's numeric keypad
               together with 12 function keys) should be assumed rather than
               DEC VT220.  This causes the keypad "+" to be mapped to ",".
               and CTRL F1-F10 to F11-F20, depending on the setting of the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:ctrlFKeys">ctrlFKeys</a></b> resource, so <i>xterm</i> emulates a DEC VT220 more
               accurately.  Otherwise (the default, with <b><a href="#Application-Resources:sunKeyboard">sunKeyboard</a></b> set to
               "false"), <i>xterm</i> uses PC-style bindings for the function keys
               and keypad.

               PC-style bindings use the Shift, Alt, Control and Meta keys as
               modifiers for function-keys and keypad (see <i>Xterm Control</i>
               <i>Sequences</i> for details).  The PC-style bindings are analogous to
               PCTerm, but not the same thing.  Normally these bindings do not
               conflict with the use of the Meta key as described for the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitInput">eightBitInput</a></b> resource.  If they do, note that the PC-style

               This is very useful for overriding the default terminal

               started.  Note, however, that the <i>stty</i> program on a given host
               may use different keywords; <i>xterm</i>'s table is built in.  The
               <i>POSIX</i> column in the table indicates which keywords are
               supported by a standard <i>stty</i> program.

               If the <b><a href="#Application-Resources:ttyModes">ttyModes</a></b> resource specifies a value for <b>erase</b>, that
               overrides the <b><a href="#Application-Resources:ptyInitialErase">ptyInitialErase</a></b> resource setting, i.e., <i>xterm</i>
               initializes the terminal to match that value.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:useInsertMode" name="Application-Resources:useInsertMode">useInsertMode</a></b> (class <b>UseInsertMode</b>)
               Force use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the
               TERMCAP environment variable.  This is useful if the system
               termcap is broken.  (This resource is ignored on most systems,
               because TERMCAP is not used).  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:utmpDisplayId" name="Application-Resources:utmpDisplayId">utmpDisplayId</a></b> (class <b>UtmpDisplayId</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should try to record the display
               identifier (display number and screen number) as well as the
               hostname in the system <i>utmp</i> log file.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:utmpInhibit" name="Application-Resources:utmpInhibit">utmpInhibit</a></b> (class <b>UtmpInhibit</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should try to record the user's
               terminal in the system <i>utmp</i> log file.  If true, <i>xterm</i> will not
               try.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:validShells" name="Application-Resources:validShells">validShells</a></b> (class <b>ValidShells</b>)
               Augment (add to) the system's <i>/etc/shells</i>, when determining
               whether to set the "SHELL" environment variable when running a
               given program.

               The resource value is a list of lines (separated by newlines).
               Each line holds one pathname.  <i>Xterm</i> ignores any line beginning
               with "#" after trimming leading/trailing whitespace from each
               line.

               The default is an empty string.

       <b><a title="Application Resources:waitForMap" name="Application-Resources:waitForMap">waitForMap</a></b> (class <b>WaitForMap</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should wait for the initial
               window map before starting the subprocess.  This is part of the
               <b><a href="#Application-Resources:ptyHandshake">ptyHandshake</a></b> logic.  When <i>xterm</i> is directed to wait in this
               fashion, it passes the terminal size from the display end of
               the pseudo-terminal to the terminal I/O connection, e.g., using
               the size according to the window manager.  Otherwise, it uses
               the size as given in resource values or command-line option
               <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-geometry">-geometry</a></b>.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:zIconBeep" name="Application-Resources:zIconBeep">zIconBeep</a></b> (class <b>ZIconBeep</b>)
               Same as -ziconbeep command line argument.  If the value of this
               resource is non-zero, xterms that produce output while
               iconified will cause an XBell sound at the given volume and
               have "*** " prepended to their icon titles.  Most window
               managers will detect this change immediately, showing you which
               window has the output.  (A similar feature was in x10 <i>xterm</i>.)
               The default is "false".

       <b><a title="Application Resources:zIconTitleFormat" name="Application-Resources:zIconTitleFormat">zIconTitleFormat</a></b> (class <b>ZIconTitleFormat</b>)
               Allow customization of the string used in the <b><a href="#Application-Resources:zIconBeep">zIconBeep</a></b>
               feature.  The default value is "*** %s".

               If the resource value contains a "%s", then <i>xterm</i> inserts the
               icon title at that point rather than prepending the string to
               the icon title.  (Only the first "%s" is used).

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-VT100-Widget-Resources" id="h3-VT100-Widget-Resources">VT100 Widget Resources</a></h3>
<pre>       The following resources are specified as part of the <i>vt100</i> widget
       (class <i>VT100</i>).  They are specified by patterns such as
       "<b>XTerm.vt100.</b><i>NAME</i>".

       If your <i>xterm</i> is configured to support the "toolbar", then those
       patterns need an extra level for the form-widget which holds the
       toolbar and vt100 widget.  A wildcard between the top-level "XTerm" and
       the "vt100" widget makes the resource settings work for either, e.g.,
       "<b>XTerm*vt100.</b><i>NAME</i>".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:activeIcon" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:activeIcon">activeIcon</a></b> (class <b>ActiveIcon</b>)
               Specifies whether or not active icon windows are to be used
               when the <i>xterm</i> window is iconified, if this feature is compiled
               into <i>xterm</i>.  The active icon is a miniature representation of
               the content of the window and will update as the content
               changes.  Not all window managers necessarily support
               application icon windows.  Some window managers will allow you
               to enter keystrokes into the active icon window.  The default
               is "default".

               <i>Xterm</i> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number
               shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      No active icon is shown.

               true (1)
                      The active icon is shown.  If you are using <i>twm</i>, use
                      this setting to enable active-icons.

               default (2)
                      <i>Xterm</i> checks at startup, and shows an active icon only
                      for window managers which it can identify and which are
                      known to support the feature.  These are <i>fvwm</i> (full
                      support), and <i>window maker</i> (limited).  A few other
                      window managers (such as <i>twm</i> and <i>ctwm</i>) support active
                      icons, but do not support the extensions which allow
                      <i>xterm</i> to identify the window manager.

               When set to "false", <i>xterm</i> will not use bold fonts.  This

               Specifies whether control sequences that enable <i>xterm</i> to send
               escape sequences to the host on mouse-clicks and movement.  The
               default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:allowPasteControls" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:allowPasteControls">allowPasteControls</a></b> (class <b>AllowPasteControls</b>)
               If true, allow control characters such as BEL and CAN to be
               pasted.  Formatting characters (tab, newline) are normally
               allowed, unless suppressed via the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:disallowedPasteControls">disallowedPasteControls</a></b>
               resource.  Other C0 control characters are suppressed unless
               this resource is enabled.  The exact set of control characters
               (C0 and C1) depends upon whether UTF-8 encoding is used, as
               well as the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:allowC1Printable">allowC1Printable</a></b> and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:disallowedPasteControls">disallowedPasteControls</a></b>
               resources.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:allowScrollLock" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:allowScrollLock">allowScrollLock</a></b> (class <b>AllowScrollLock</b>)
               Specifies whether control sequences that set/query the Scroll
               Lock key should be allowed, as well as whether the Scroll Lock
               key responds to user's keypress.  The default is "false".

               When this feature is enabled, <i>xterm</i> will sense the state of the
               Scroll Lock key each time it acquires focus.  Pressing the
               Scroll Lock key toggles <i>xterm</i>'s internal state, as well as
               toggling the associated LED.  While the Scroll Lock is active,
               <i>xterm</i> attempts to keep a viewport on the same set of lines.  If
               the current viewport is scrolled past the limit set by the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:saveLines">saveLines</a></b> resource, then Scroll Lock has no further effect.

               The reason for setting the default to "false" is to avoid user
               surprise.  This key is generally unused in keyboard
               configurations, and has not acquired a standard meaning even
               when it is used in that manner.  Consequently, users have
               assigned it for ad hoc purposes.

               See also the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:autoScrollLock">autoScrollLock</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:allowSendEvents" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:allowSendEvents">allowSendEvents</a></b> (class <b>AllowSendEvents</b>)
               Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events
               (generated using the X protocol SendEvent request) should be
               interpreted or discarded.  The default is "false" meaning they
               are discarded.  Note that allowing such events would create a
               very large security hole, therefore enabling this resource
               forcefully disables the <b>allow</b><i>XXX</i><b>Ops</b> resources.  The default is
               "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:allowTcapOps" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:allowTcapOps">allowTcapOps</a></b> (class <b>AllowTcapOps</b>)
               Specifies whether control sequences that query the terminal's
               notion of its function-key strings, as termcap or terminfo
               capabilities should be allowed.  The default is "true".

               A few programs, e.g., <i>vim</i>, use this feature to get an accurate
               description of the terminal's capabilities, independent of the
               termcap/terminfo setting:

               <b>o</b>   <i>Xterm</i> can tell the querying program how many colors it
                   supports.  This is a constant, depending on how it is
                   compiled, typically 16.  It does not change if you alter
                   resource settings, e.g., the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:boldColors">boldColors</a></b> resource.

               <b>o</b>   <i>Xterm</i> can tell the querying program what strings are sent
                   by modified (shift-, control-, alt-) function- and keypad-
                   keys.  Reporting control- and alt-modifiers is a feature
                   that relies on the <i>ncurses</i> extended naming.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:allowTitleOps" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:allowTitleOps">allowTitleOps</a></b> (class <b>AllowTitleOps</b>)
               Specifies whether control sequences that modify the window
               title or icon name should be allowed.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:allowWindowOps" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:allowWindowOps">allowWindowOps</a></b> (class <b>AllowWindowOps</b>)
               Specifies whether extended window control sequences (as used in
               <i>dtterm</i>) should be allowed.  These include several control
               sequences which manipulate the window size or position, as well
               as reporting these values and the title or icon name.  Each of
               these can be abused in a script; curiously enough most terminal
               emulators that implement these restrict only a small part of
               the repertoire.  For fine-tuning, see <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:disallowedWindowOps">disallowedWindowOps</a></b>.  The
               default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:altIsNotMeta" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:altIsNotMeta">altIsNotMeta</a></b> (class <b>AltIsNotMeta</b>)
               If "true", treat the Alt-key as if it were the Meta-key.  Your
               keyboard may happen to be configured so they are the same.  But
               if they are not, this allows you to use the same prefix- and
               shifting operations with the Alt-key as with the Meta-key.  See
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:altSendsEscape">altSendsEscape</a></b> and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:metaSendsEscape">metaSendsEscape</a></b>.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:altSendsEscape" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:altSendsEscape">altSendsEscape</a></b> (class <b>AltSendsEscape</b>)
               This is an additional keyboard operation that may be processed
               after the logic for <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:metaSendsEscape">metaSendsEscape</a></b>.  It is only available if
               the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:altIsNotMeta">altIsNotMeta</a></b> resource is set.

               <b>o</b>   If "true", Alt characters (a character combined with the
                   modifier associated with left/right Alt-keys) are converted
                   into a two-character sequence with the character itself
                   preceded by ESC.  This applies as well to function key
                   control sequences, unless <i>xterm</i> sees that <b>Alt</b> is used in
                   your key translations.

               <b>o</b>   If "false", Alt characters input from the keyboard cause a
                   shift to 8-bit characters (just like <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:metaSendsEscape">metaSendsEscape</a></b>).  By
                   combining the Alt- and Meta-modifiers, you can create
                   corresponding combinations of ESC-prefix and 8-bit
                   characters.

               The default is "False".  <i>Xterm</i> provides a menu option for
               toggling this resource.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:alternateScroll" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:alternateScroll">alternateScroll</a></b> (class <b>ScrollCond</b>)
               If "true", the <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-back">scroll-back</a></b> and <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-forw">scroll-forw</a></b> actions send
               cursor-up and -down keys when <i>xterm</i> is displaying the alternate
               screen.  The default is "false".

               The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:alternateScroll">alternateScroll</a></b> state can also be set using a control
               sequence.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:alwaysBoldMode" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:alwaysBoldMode">alwaysBoldMode</a></b> (class <b>AlwaysBoldMode</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should check if the normal and bold
               fonts are distinct before deciding whether to use overstriking
               to simulate bold fonts.  If this resource is true, <i>xterm</i> does
               not make the check for distinct fonts when deciding how to
               handle the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:boldMode">boldMode</a></b> resource.  The default is "false".

               <i>boldMode   alwaysBoldMode   Comparison   Action</i>
               ----------------------------------------------------
               false      false            ignored      use font
               false      true             ignored      use font
               true       false            same         overstrike
               true       false            different    use font
               true       true             ignored      overstrike

               This resource is used only for bitmap fonts:

               <b>o</b>   When using bitmap fonts, it is possible that the font
                   server will approximate the bold font by rescaling it from
                   a different font size than expected.  The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:alwaysBoldMode">alwaysBoldMode</a></b>
                   resource allows the user to override the (sometimes poor)
                   resulting bold font with overstriking (which is at least
                   consistent).

               <b>o</b>   The problem does not occur with TrueType fonts (though
                   there can be other unnecessary issues such as different
                   coverage of the normal and bold fonts).

               As an alternative, setting the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:allowBoldFonts">allowBoldFonts</a></b> resource to false
               overrides both the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:alwaysBoldMode">alwaysBoldMode</a></b> and the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:boldMode">boldMode</a></b> resources.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:alwaysHighlight" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:alwaysHighlight">alwaysHighlight</a></b> (class <b>AlwaysHighlight</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should always display a
               highlighted text cursor.  By default (if this resource is
               false), a hollow text cursor is displayed whenever the pointer
               moves out of the window or the window loses the input focus.
               The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:alwaysUseMods" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:alwaysUseMods">alwaysUseMods</a></b> (class <b>AlwaysUseMods</b>)
               Override the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:numLock">numLock</a></b> resource, telling <i>xterm</i> to use the Alt and
               Meta modifiers to construct parameters for function key
               sequences even if those modifiers appear in the translations
               resource.  Normally <i>xterm</i> checks if Alt or Meta is used in a
               translation that would conflict with function key modifiers,
               and will ignore these modifiers in that special case.  The
               default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:answerbackString" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:answerbackString">answerbackString</a></b> (class <b>AnswerbackString</b>)
               Specifies the string that <i>xterm</i> sends in response to an ENQ
               (control/E) character from the host.  The default is a blank
               string, i.e., "".  A hardware VT100 implements this feature as
               a setup option.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:appcursorDefault" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:appcursorDefault">appcursorDefault</a></b> (class <b>AppcursorDefault</b>)
               If "true", the cursor keys are initially in application mode.
               This is the same as the VT102 private DECCKM mode, The default
               is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:appkeypadDefault" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:appkeypadDefault">appkeypadDefault</a></b> (class <b>AppkeypadDefault</b>)
               If "true", the keypad keys are initially in application mode.
               The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:assumeAllChars" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:assumeAllChars">assumeAllChars</a></b> (class <b>AssumeAllChars</b>)
               If "true", this enables a special case in bitmap fonts to allow
               the font server to choose how to display missing glyphs.  The
               default is "true".

               The reason for this resource is to help with certain quasi-
               automatically generated fonts (such as the ISO-10646-1 encoding
               of Terminus) which have incorrect font-metrics.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:autoScrollLock" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:autoScrollLock">autoScrollLock</a></b> (class <b>AutoScrollLock</b>)
               If "true", <i>xterm</i> will maintain its viewport of displayed lines
               whenever displaying scrollback, as if <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:allowScrollLock">allowScrollLock</a></b> were
               enabled and the Scroll Lock key had been pressed.  The default
               is "false".  This feature is only useful if the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:scrollTtyOutput">scrollTtyOutput</a></b>
               resource is set to "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:autoWrap" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:autoWrap">autoWrap</a></b> (class <b>AutoWrap</b>)
               Specifies whether or not auto-wraparound should be enabled.
               This is the same as the VT102 DECAWM.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:awaitInput" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:awaitInput">awaitInput</a></b> (class <b>AwaitInput</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> uses a 50 millisecond timeout to
               await input (i.e., to support the <i>Xaw3d</i> arrow scrollbar).  The
               default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:backarrowKey" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:backarrowKey">backarrowKey</a></b> (class <b>BackarrowKey</b>)
               Specifies whether the backarrow key transmits a backspace (8)
               or delete (127) character.  This corresponds to the DECBKM
               control sequence.  A "true" value specifies backspace.  The
               default is "True".  Pressing the control key toggles this
               behavior.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:background" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:background">background</a></b> (class <b>Background</b>)
               Specifies the color to use for the background of the window.
               The default is "XtDefaultBackground".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:bellIsUrgent" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:bellIsUrgent">bellIsUrgent</a></b> (class <b>BellIsUrgent</b>)
               Specifies whether to set the Urgency hint for the window
               manager when making a bell sound.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:bellOnReset" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:bellOnReset">bellOnReset</a></b> (class <b>BellOnReset</b>)
               Specifies whether to sound a bell when doing a hard reset.  The
               default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:bellSuppressTime" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:bellSuppressTime">bellSuppressTime</a></b> (class <b>BellSuppressTime</b>)
               Number of milliseconds after a bell command is sent during
               which additional bells will be suppressed.  Default is 200.  If
               set non-zero, additional bells will also be suppressed until
               the server reports that processing of the first bell has been
               completed; this feature is most useful with the visible bell.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:boldColors" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:boldColors">boldColors</a></b> (class <b>ColorMode</b>)
               Specifies whether to combine bold attribute with colors like
               the IBM PC, i.e., map colors 0 through 7 to colors 8 through
               15.  These normally are the brighter versions of the first 8
               colors, hence bold.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:boldFont" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:boldFont">boldFont</a></b> (class <b>BoldFont</b>)
               Specifies the name of the bold font to use instead of
               overstriking.  There is no default for this resource.

               This font must be the same height and width as the normal font,
               otherwise it is ignored.  If only one of the normal or bold
               fonts is specified, it will be used as the normal font and the
               bold font will be produced by overstriking this font.

               See also the discussion of <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:boldMode">boldMode</a></b> and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:alwaysBoldMode">alwaysBoldMode</a></b>
               resources.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:boldMode" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:boldMode">boldMode</a></b> (class <b>BoldMode</b>)
               This specifies whether or not text with the bold attribute
               should be overstruck to simulate bold fonts if the resolved
               bold font is the same as the normal font.  It may be desirable
               to disable bold fonts when color is being used for the bold
               attribute.

               Note that <i>xterm</i> has one bold font which you may set explicitly.
               <i>Xterm</i> attempts to derive a bold font for the other font
               selections (<b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:font1">font1</a></b> through <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:font7">font7</a></b>).  If it cannot find a bold
               font, it will use the normal font.  In each case (whether the
               explicit resource or the derived font), if the normal and bold
               fonts are distinct, this resource has no effect.  The default
               is "true".

               See the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:alwaysBoldMode">alwaysBoldMode</a></b> resource which can modify the behavior
               of this resource.

               Although <i>xterm</i> attempts to derive a bold font for other font
               selections, the font server may not cooperate.  Since X11R6,
               bitmap fonts have been scaled.  The font server claims to
               provide the bold font that <i>xterm</i> requests, but the result is
               not always readable.  XFree86 introduced a feature which can be
               used to suppress the scaling.  In the X server's configuration
               file (e.g., "/etc/X11/XFree86" or "/etc/X11/xorg.conf"), you
               can add ":unscaled" to the end of the directory specification
               for the "misc" fonts, which comprise the fixed-pitch fonts that
               are used by <i>xterm</i>.  For example

                   FontPath                 "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"

               would become

                   FontPath                 "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled"

               Depending on your configuration, the font server may have its
               own configuration file.  The same ":unscaled" can be added to

               specification for "misc".

               The bitmap scaling feature is also used by <i>xterm</i> to implement

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:brokenLinuxOSC" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:brokenLinuxOSC">brokenLinuxOSC</a></b> (class <b>BrokenLinuxOSC</b>)
               If true, <i>xterm</i> applies a workaround to ignore malformed control
               sequences that a Linux script might send.  Compare the palette
               control sequences documented in <i>console_codes</i> with ECMA-48.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:brokenSelections" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:brokenSelections">brokenSelections</a></b> (class <b>BrokenSelections</b>)
               If true, <i>xterm</i> in 8-bit mode will interpret <b>STRING</b> selections
               as carrying text in the current locale's encoding.  Normally
               <b>STRING</b> selections carry ISO-8859-1 encoded text.  Setting this
               resource to "true" violates the ICCCM; it may, however, be
               useful for interacting with some broken X clients.  The default
               is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:brokenStringTerm" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:brokenStringTerm">brokenStringTerm</a></b> (class <b>BrokenStringTerm</b>)
               provides a work-around for some ISDN routers which start an
               application control string without completing it.  Set this to
               "true" if <i>xterm</i> appears to freeze when connecting.  The default
               is "false".

               <i>Xterm</i>'s state parser recognizes several types of control
               strings which can contain text, e.g.,

               <b>APC</b> (Application Program Command),
               <b>DCS</b> (Device Control String),
               <b>OSC</b> (Operating System Command),
               <b>PM</b> (Privacy Message), and
               <b>SOS</b> (Start of String),

               Each should end with a string-terminator (a special character
               which cannot appear in these strings).  Ordinary control
               characters found within the string are not ignored; they are
               processed without interfering with the process of accumulating
               the control string's content.  <i>Xterm</i> recognizes these controls
               in all modes, although some of the functions may be suppressed
               after parsing the control.

               When enabled, this feature allows the user to exit from an
               unterminated control string when any of these ordinary control
               characters are found:

               control/D (used as an end of file in many shells),
               control/H (backspace),
               control/I (tab-feed),
               control/J (line feed aka newline),

               control/N (shift-out),
               control/O (shift-in),
               control/Q (XOFF),

                      the current screen is added to the scrollback, but
                      repeated blank lines are trimmed (reduced to a single

               DEC VT420 and up support a control sequence <b>DECRQCRA</b> which
               reports the checksum of the characters in a rectangle.  <i>Xterm</i>
               supports this, with extensions that can be configured with bits
               of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:checksumExtension">checksumExtension</a></b>:

               0    do not negate the result.

               4    do not mask cell value to 8 bits or ignore combining
                    characters.

               5    do not mask cell value to 7 bits.

               With the default value (0), <i>xterm</i> matches the behavior of DEC's

               Resources past <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:color15">color15</a></b> are available as a compile-time option.
               Due to a hardcoded limit in the X libraries on the total number
               of resources (to 400), the resources for 256-colors are omitted
               when wide-character support and <i>luit</i> are enabled.  Besides
               inconsistent behavior if only part of the resources were
               allowed, determining the exact cutoff is difficult, and the X
               libraries tend to crash if the number of resources exceeds the
               limit.  The color palette is still initialized to the same
               default values, and can be modified via control sequences.

               On the other hand, the resource limit does permit including the

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:cursorBlink" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlink">cursorBlink</a></b> (class <b>CursorBlink</b>)
               Specifies whether to make the cursor blink.  <i>Xterm</i> accepts
               either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in
               parentheses:

               false (0)
                  The cursor will not blink, but may be combined with escape
                  sequences according to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlinkXOR">cursorBlinkXOR</a></b> resource.

               true (1)
                  The cursor will blink, but may be combined with escape
                  sequences according to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlinkXOR">cursorBlinkXOR</a></b> resource.

               always (2)
                  The cursor will always blink, ignoring escape sequences.
                  The menu entry will be disabled.

               never (3)
                  The cursor will never blink, ignoring escape sequences.  The
                  menu entry will be disabled.

               The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:cursorBlinkXOR" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlinkXOR">cursorBlinkXOR</a></b> (class <b>CursorBlinkXOR</b>)
               <i>Xterm</i> uses two inputs to determine whether the cursor blinks:

               <b>o</b>   The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlink">cursorBlink</a></b> resource (which can be altered with a menu
                   entry).

               <b>o</b>   Control sequences (private mode 12 and DECSCUSR).

               The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlinkXOR">cursorBlinkXOR</a></b> resource determines how those inputs are
               combined:

               false
                    <i>Xterm</i> uses the logical-OR of the two variables.  If either
                    is set, <i>xterm</i> makes the cursor blink.

               true
                    <i>Xterm</i> uses the logical-XOR of the two variables.  If only
                    one is set, <i>xterm</i> makes the cursor blink.

               The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:cursorColor" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorColor">cursorColor</a></b> (class <b>CursorColor</b>)
               Specifies the color to use for the text cursor.  The default is
               "XtDefaultForeground".  By default, <i>xterm</i> attempts to keep this
               color from being the same as the background color, since it
               draws the cursor by filling the background of a text cell.  The
               same restriction applies to control sequences which may change
               this color.

               Setting this resource overrides most of <i>xterm</i>'s adjustments to
               cursor color.  It will still use reverse-video to disallow some
               cases, such as a black cursor on a black background.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:cursorOffTime" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorOffTime">cursorOffTime</a></b> (class <b>CursorOffTime</b>)
               Specifies the duration of the "off" part of the cursor blink
               cycle-time in milliseconds.  The same timer is used for text
               blinking.  The default is "300".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:cursorOnTime" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorOnTime">cursorOnTime</a></b> (class <b>CursorOnTime</b>)
               Specifies the duration of the "on" part of the cursor blink
               cycle-time, in milliseconds.  The same timer is used for text
               blinking.  The default is "600".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:cursorUnderLine" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorUnderLine">cursorUnderLine</a></b> (class <b>CursorUnderLine</b>)
               Specifies whether to make the cursor underlined or a box.  If
               unset (false), the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBar">cursorBar</a></b> resource may set the cursor shape.
               The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:cutNewline" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:cutNewline">cutNewline</a></b> (class <b>CutNewline</b>)
               If "false", triple clicking to select a line does not include
               the <i>newline</i> at the end of the line.  If "true", the Newline is
               selected.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:cutToBeginningOfLine" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:cutToBeginningOfLine">cutToBeginningOfLine</a></b> (class <b>CutToBeginningOfLine</b>)
               If "false", triple clicking to select a line selects only from
               the current word forward.  If "true", the entire line is
               selected.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:decGraphicsID" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:decGraphicsID">decGraphicsID</a></b> (class <b>DecGraphicsID</b>)
               Allows a way to combine the graphics feature from certain DEC
               terminals (125, 240, 241, 330, 340 or 382) with other emulation
               levels which did not provide the graphics feature.  As in
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:decTerminalID">decTerminalID</a></b>, leading non-digit characters are ignored, e.g.,
               "vt340" and "340" are the same.

               If the resource value is nonzero, <i>xterm</i> uses that emulation
               level when initializing the drawing region and decoding control
               sequences to draw graphics.

               The default is "0".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:decTerminalID" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:decTerminalID">decTerminalID</a></b> (class <b>DecTerminalID</b>)
               Specifies the emulation level (100=VT100, 220=VT220, etc.),
               used to determine the type of response to a DA control
               sequence.  Leading non-digit characters are ignored, e.g.,
               "vt100" and "100" are the same.  The default is "420".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:defaultString" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:defaultString">defaultString</a></b> (class <b>DefaultString</b>)
               Specify the character (or string) which <i>xterm</i> will substitute
               when pasted text includes a character which cannot be
               represented in the current encoding.  For instance, pasting
               UTF-8 text into a display of ISO-8859-1 characters will only be
               able to display codes 0-255, while UTF-8 text can include
               Unicode values above 255.  The default is "#" (a single pound
               sign).

               If the undisplayable text would be double-width, <i>xterm</i> will add
               a space after the "#" character, to give roughly the same
               layout on the screen as the original text.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:deleteIsDEL" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:deleteIsDEL">deleteIsDEL</a></b> (class <b>DeleteIsDEL</b>)
               Specifies what the <i>Delete</i> key on the editing keypad should send
               when pressed.  The resource value is a string, evaluated as a
               boolean after startup.  <i>Xterm</i> uses it in conjunction with the
               <b><a href="#Application-Resources:keyboardType">keyboardType</a></b> resource:

               <b>o</b>   If the keyboard type is "default", or "vt220" and the
                   resource is either "true" or "maybe" send the VT220-style
                   <i>Remove</i> escape sequence.  Otherwise, send DEL (127).

               <b>o</b>   If the keyboard type is "legacy", and the resource is
                   "true" send DEL.  Otherwise, send the <i>Remove</i> sequence.

               <b>o</b>   Otherwise, if the keyboard type is none of these special
                   cases, send DEL (127).

               The default is "Maybe".  The resource is allowed to be a non-
               boolean "maybe" so that the popup menu <b><a href="#Main-Options:Delete-is-DEL">Delete is DEL</a></b> entry does
               not override the keyboard type.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:directColor" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:directColor">directColor</a></b> (class <b>DirectColor</b>)
               Specifies whether to handle direct-color control sequences
               using the X server's available colors, or to approximate those
               using a color map with 256 entries.  A "true" value enables the

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:dynamicColors" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:dynamicColors">dynamicColors</a></b> (class <b>DynamicColors</b>)
               Specifies whether or not escape sequences to change colors
               assigned to different attributes are recognized.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:eightBitControl" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitControl">eightBitControl</a></b> (class <b>EightBitControl</b>)
               Specifies whether or not control sequences sent by the terminal
               should be eight-bit characters or escape sequences.  The
               default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:eightBitInput" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitInput">eightBitInput</a></b> (class <b>EightBitInput</b>)
               If "true", Meta characters (a single-byte character combined
               with the <i>Meta</i> modifier key) input from the keyboard are
               presented as a single character, modified according to the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitMeta">eightBitMeta</a></b> resource.  If "false", Meta characters are
               converted into a two-character sequence with the character
               itself preceded by ESC.  The default is "true".

               The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:metaSendsEscape">metaSendsEscape</a></b> and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:altSendsEscape">altSendsEscape</a></b> resources may override
               this feature.  Generally keyboards do not have a key labeled
               "Meta", but "Alt" keys are common, and they are conventionally
               used for "Meta".  If they were synonymous, it would have been
               reasonable to name this resource "<b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:altSendsEscape">altSendsEscape</a></b>", reversing
               its sense.  For more background on this, see the <a href="/ncurses/man/curs_inopts.3x.html#h3-meta"><b>meta(3X)</b></a>
               function in curses.

               Note that the <i>Alt</i> key is not necessarily the same as the <i>Meta</i>
               modifier.  The <i>xmodmap</i> utility lists your key modifiers.  X
               defines modifiers for shift, (caps) lock and control, as well
               as 5 additional modifiers which are generally used to configure
               key modifiers.  <i>Xterm</i> inspects the same information to find the
               modifier associated with either <i>Meta</i> key (left or right), and
               uses that key as the <i>Meta</i> modifier.  It also looks for the
               NumLock key, to recognize the modifier which is associated with
               that.

               If your <i>xmodmap</i> configuration uses the same keycodes for Alt-
               and Meta-keys, <i>xterm</i> will only see the Alt-key definitions,
               since those are tested before Meta-keys.  NumLock is tested
               first.  It is important to keep these keys distinct; otherwise
               some of <i>xterm</i>'s functionality is not available.

               The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitInput">eightBitInput</a></b> resource is tested at startup time.  If
               "true", the <i>xterm</i> tries to put the terminal into 8-bit mode.
               If "false", on startup, <i>xterm</i> tries to put the terminal into
               7-bit mode.  For some configurations this is unsuccessful;
               failure is ignored.  After startup, <i>xterm</i> does not change the
               terminal between 8-bit and 7-bit mode.

               As originally implemented in X11, the resource value did not
               change after startup.  However (since patch #216 in 2006) <i>xterm</i>
               can modify <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitInput">eightBitInput</a></b> after startup via a control sequence.
               The corresponding terminfo capabilities <b>smm</b> (set meta mode) and
               <b>rmm</b> (reset meta mode) have been recognized by <i>bash</i> for some
               time.  Interestingly enough, <i>bash</i>'s notion of "meta mode"
               differs from the standard definition (in the <i>terminfo</i> manual),
               which describes the change to the eighth bit of a character.
               It happens that <i>bash</i> views "meta mode" as the ESC character
               that <i>xterm</i> puts before a character when a special meta key is
               pressed.  <i>bash</i>'s early documentation talks about the ESC
               character and ignores the eighth bit.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:eightBitMeta" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitMeta">eightBitMeta</a></b> (class <b>EightBitMeta</b>)
               This controls the way <i>xterm</i> modifies the eighth bit of a
               single-byte key when the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitInput">eightBitInput</a></b> resource is set.  The
               default is "locale".

               The resource value is a string, evaluated as a boolean after
               startup.

               false
                    The key is sent unmodified.

               locale
                    The key is modified only if the locale uses eight-bit
                    encoding.

               true The key is sent modified.

               never
                    The key is always sent unmodified.

               Except for the <b>never</b> choice, <i>xterm</i> honors the terminfo
               capabilities <b>smm</b> (set meta mode) and <b>rmm</b> (reset meta mode),
               allowing the feature to be turned on or off dynamically.

               If <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitMeta">eightBitMeta</a></b> is enabled when the locale uses UTF-8, <i>xterm</i>
               encodes the value as UTF-8 (since patch #183 in 2003).

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:eightBitOutput" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitOutput">eightBitOutput</a></b> (class <b>EightBitOutput</b>)
               Specifies whether or not eight-bit characters sent from the
               host should be accepted as is or stripped when printed.  The
               default is "true", which means that they are accepted as is.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:eightBitSelectTypes" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitSelectTypes">eightBitSelectTypes</a></b> (class <b>EightBitSelectTypes</b>)
               Override <i>xterm</i>'s default selection target list (see
               <b><a href="#h2-SELECT_PASTE">SELECT/PASTE</a></b>) for selections in normal (ISO-8859-1) mode.  The
               default is an empty string, i.e., "", which does not override
               anything.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:eraseSavedLines" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:eraseSavedLines">eraseSavedLines</a></b> (class <b>EraseSavedLines</b>)
               Specifies whether or not to allow <i>xterm</i> extended ED/DECSED
               control sequences to erase the saved-line buffer.  The default
               is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:faceName" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> (class <b>FaceName</b>)
               Specify the pattern for scalable fonts selected from the
               FreeType library if support for that library was compiled into
               <i>xterm</i>.  There is no default value.

               One or more fonts can be specified, separated by commas.  If
               prefixed with "x:" or "x11:" the specification applies to the
               XLFD <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:font">font</a></b> resource.  A "xft:" prefix is accepted but
               unnecessary since a missing prefix for <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> means that it
               will be used for TrueType.  For example,

                   XTerm*faceName: x:fixed,xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono

               Two TrueType fonts can be specified in this way.  The first is
               the primary font; the second acts as a manual override to the
               <i>fontconfig</i> fontset.

               If no <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> resource is specified, or if there is no match
               for both TrueType normal and bold fonts, <i>xterm</i> uses the XLFD
               (bitmap) <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:font">font</a></b> and related resources.

               It is possible to select suitable bitmap fonts using a script
               such as this:

                   #!/bin/sh
                   FONT=`xfontsel -print`
                   test -n "$FONT" &amp;&amp; xfd -fn "$FONT"

               However (even though <i>xfd</i> accepts a "<b><a href="#OPTIONS:-fa">-fa</a></b>" option to denote
               FreeType fonts), <i>xfontsel</i> has not been similarly extended.  As
               a workaround, you may try

                   fc-list :scalable=true:spacing=mono: family

               to find a list of scalable fixed-pitch fonts which may be used
               for the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> resource value.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:faceNameDoublesize" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:faceNameDoublesize">faceNameDoublesize</a></b> (class <b>FaceNameDoublesize</b>)
               Specify a double-width scalable font for cases where an
               application requires this, e.g., in CJK applications.  There is
               no default value.

               Like the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> resource, this allows one or more comma-
               separated font specifications to be applied to the <i>wide</i>
               TrueType or XLFD fonts.

               If the application uses double-wide characters and this
               resource is not given, <i>xterm</i> will use a scaled version of the
               font given by <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b>.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:faceSize" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:faceSize">faceSize</a></b> (class <b>FaceSize</b>)
               Specify the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType
               library if support for that library was compiled into <i>xterm</i>.
               The default is "8.0" On the <b><a href="#h3-VT-Fonts">VT Fonts</a></b> menu, this corresponds to
               the <i>Default</i> entry.

               Although the default is "8.0", this may not be the same as the
               pointsize for the default bitmap font, i.e., that assigned with
               the <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-fn">-fn</a></b> option, or the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:font">font</a></b> resource.  The default value of
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceSize">faceSize</a></b> is chosen to match the size of the "fixed" font,
               making switching between bitmap and TrueType fonts via the font
               menu give comparable sizes for the window.  If your <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-fn">-fn</a></b> option
               uses a different pointsize, you might want to adjust the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceSize">faceSize</a></b> resource to match.

               You can specify the pointsize for TrueType fonts selected with
               the other size-related menu entries such as Medium, Huge, etc.,
               by using one of the following resource values.  If you do not
               specify a value, they default to "0.0", which causes <i>xterm</i> to
               use the ratio of font sizes from the corresponding bitmap font
               resources to obtain a TrueType pointsize.

               If all of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceSize">faceSize</a></b> resources are set, then <i>xterm</i> will use
               this information to determine the next smaller/larger TrueType
               font for the <b><a href="#Actions:larger-vt-font">larger-vt-font</a></b><b>()</b> and <b><a href="#Actions:smaller-vt-font">smaller-vt-font</a></b><b>()</b> actions.
               If any are not set, <i>xterm</i> will use only the areas of the bitmap
               fonts.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:faceSize1" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:faceSize1">faceSize1</a></b> (class <b>FaceSize1</b>)

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:faintIsRelative" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:faintIsRelative">faintIsRelative</a></b> (class <b>FaintIsRelative</b>)
               Faint colors are derived from the current text color, e.g., the
               ANSI colors, by scaling the red, green and blue components.
               Use this resource to specify whether that is done relative to
               the current background color, or as an absolute value.  The
               default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:fastScroll" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:fastScroll">fastScroll</a></b> (class <b>FastScroll</b>)
               Modifies the effect of jump scroll (<b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:jumpScroll">jumpScroll</a></b>) by suppressing
               screen refreshes for the special case when output to the screen
               has completely shifted the contents off-screen.  Likewise,
               screen refreshes for related actions, e.g., carriage returns,
               are suppressed.

               For instance, <i>cat</i>'ing a large file to the screen normally
               results in a large number of screen refreshes.  By suppressing
               the corresponding refreshes, scrolling speed improves.

               The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:font" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:font">font</a></b> (class <b>Font</b>)

               See the discussion of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:locale">locale</a></b> resource, which describes how
               this font may be overridden.

               NOTE: some resource files use patterns such as

               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should attempt to use font scaling to
               draw double-sized characters.  Some older font servers cannot
               do this properly, will return misleading font metrics.  The
               default is "true".  If disabled, <i>xterm</i> will simulate double-
               sized characters by drawing normal characters with spaces
               between them.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:fontWarnings" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:fontWarnings">fontWarnings</a></b> (class <b>FontWarnings</b>)
               Specify whether <i>xterm</i> should report an error if it fails to
               load a font:

               0    Never report an error (though the X libraries may).

               1    Report an error if the font name was given as a resource
                    setting.

               2    Always report an error on failure to load a font.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:forceBoxChars" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:forceBoxChars">forceBoxChars</a></b> (class <b>ForceBoxChars</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should assume the normal and bold fonts
               have VT100 line-drawing characters:

               <b>o</b>   The fixed-pitch ISO-8859-*-encoded fonts used by <i>xterm</i>
                   normally have the VT100 line-drawing glyphs in cells 1-31.
                   Other fixed-pitch fonts may be more attractive, but lack
                   these glyphs.

               <b>o</b>   When using an ISO-10646-1 font and the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:wideChars">wideChars</a></b> resource
                   is true, <i>xterm</i> uses the Unicode glyphs which match the
                   VT100 line-drawing glyphs.

               If "false", <i>xterm</i> checks for missing glyphs in the font and
               makes line-drawing characters directly as needed.  If "true",
               <i>xterm</i> assumes the font does not contain the line-drawing
               characters, and draws them directly.  The default is "false".

               The VT100 line-drawing character set (also known as the <i>DEC</i>
               <i>Special Character and Line Drawing Set</i>) is shown in this table.
               It includes a few <i>special</i> characters which are not used for
               drawing lines:

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:forcePackedFont" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:forcePackedFont">forcePackedFont</a></b> (class <b>ForcePackedFont</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should use the maximum or minimum glyph
               width when displaying using a bitmap font.  Use the maximum
               width to help with proportional fonts.  The default is "true",
               denoting the minimum width.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:forceXftHeight" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:forceXftHeight">forceXftHeight</a></b> (class <b>ForceXftHeight</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should use the given font metrics for
               TrueType fonts, or amend the ascent/descent to total no more
               than the given font-height.  This optional feature is used to
               work around inconsistencies in FreeType's rounding computation.
               The default is "false", denoting the given metrics.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:foreground" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:foreground">foreground</a></b> (class <b>Foreground</b>)
               Specifies the color to use for displaying text in the window.
               Setting the class name instead of the instance name is an easy
               way to have everything that would normally appear in the text
               color change color.  The default is "XtDefaultForeground".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:formatOtherKeys" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:formatOtherKeys">formatOtherKeys</a></b> (class <b>FormatOtherKeys</b>)

               0  send modified keys as parameters for function-key 27
                  (default).

               1  send modified keys as parameters for CSI u.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:freeBoldBox" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:freeBoldBox">freeBoldBox</a></b> (class <b>FreeBoldBox</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should assume the bounding boxes for
               normal and bold fonts are compatible.  If "false", <i>xterm</i>
               compares them and will reject choices of bold fonts that do not
               match the size of the normal font.  The default is "false",
               which means that the comparison is performed.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:geometry" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:geometry">geometry</a></b> (class <b>Geometry</b>)
               Specifies the preferred size and position of the VT<i>xxx</i> window.
               There is no default for this resource.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:highlightColor" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:highlightColor">highlightColor</a></b> (class <b>HighlightColor</b>)
               Specifies the color to use for the background of selected
               (highlighted) text.  If not specified (i.e., matching the
               default foreground), reverse video is used.  The default is
               "XtDefaultForeground".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:highlightColorMode" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:highlightColorMode">highlightColorMode</a></b> (class <b>HighlightColorMode</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should use <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:highlightTextColor">highlightTextColor</a></b> and
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:highlightColor">highlightColor</a></b> to override the reversed foreground/background
               colors in a selection.  The default is unspecified: at startup,
               <i>xterm</i> checks if those resources are set to something other than
               the default foreground and background colors.  Setting this
               resource disables the check.

               The following table shows the interaction of the highlighting

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:highlightReverse" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:highlightReverse">highlightReverse</a></b> (class <b>HighlightReverse</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should reverse the selection foreground
               and background colors when selecting text with reverse-video
               attribute.  This applies only to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:highlightColor">highlightColor</a></b> and
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:highlightTextColor">highlightTextColor</a></b> resources, e.g., to match the color scheme
               of <i>xwsh</i>.  If "true", <i>xterm</i> reverses the colors, If "false",
               <i>xterm</i> does not reverse colors, The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:highlightSelection" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:highlightSelection">highlightSelection</a></b> (class <b>HighlightSelection</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> whether to highlight all of the selected positions,
               or only the selected text:

               <b>o</b>   If "false", selecting with the mouse highlights all
                   positions on the screen between the beginning of the
                   selection and the current position.

               <b>o</b>   If "true", <i>xterm</i> highlights only the positions that contain
                   text that can be selected.

               The default is "false".

               Depending on the way your applications write to the screen,
               there may be trailing blanks on a line.  <i>Xterm</i> stores data as
               it is shown on the screen.  Erasing the display changes the
               internal state of each cell so it is not considered a blank for
               the purpose of selection.  Blanks written since the last erase
               are selectable.  If you do not wish to have trailing blanks in
               a selection, use the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:trimSelection">trimSelection</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:highlightTextColor" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:highlightTextColor">highlightTextColor</a></b> (class <b>HighlightTextColor</b>)
               Specifies the color to use for the foreground of selected
               (highlighted) text.  If not specified (i.e., matching the
               default background), reverse video is used.  The default is
               "XtDefaultBackground".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:hpLowerleftBugCompat" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:hpLowerleftBugCompat">hpLowerleftBugCompat</a></b> (class <b>HpLowerleftBugCompat</b>)
               Specifies whether to work around a bug in HP's <i>xdb</i>, which
               ignores termcap and always sends ESC F to move to the lower
               left corner.  "true" causes <i>xterm</i> to interpret ESC F as a
               request to move to the lower left corner of the screen.  The
               default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:i18nSelections" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:i18nSelections">i18nSelections</a></b> (class <b>I18nSelections</b>)
               If false, <i>xterm</i> will not request the targets <b>COMPOUND_TEXT</b> or
               <b>TEXT</b>.  The default is "true".  It may be set to false in order
               to work around ICCCM violations by other X clients.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:iconBorderColor" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:iconBorderColor">iconBorderColor</a></b> (class <b>BorderColor</b>)
               Specifies the border color for the active icon window if this
               feature is compiled into <i>xterm</i>.  Not all window managers will
               make the icon border visible.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:iconBorderWidth" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:iconBorderWidth">iconBorderWidth</a></b> (class <b>BorderWidth</b>)
               Specifies the border width for the active icon window if this
               feature is compiled into <i>xterm</i>.  The default is "2".  Not all
               window managers will make the border visible.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:iconFont" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:iconFont">iconFont</a></b> (class <b>IconFont</b>)
               Specifies the font for the miniature active icon window, if
               this feature is compiled into <i>xterm</i>.  The default is "nil2".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:indicatorFormat" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:indicatorFormat">indicatorFormat</a></b> (class <b>IndicatorFormat</b>)
               When displaying the status line using the <i>indicator</i> mode (i.e.,
               selecting DECSSDT line type 1), format the status using this
               resource.

               The default value of the resource displays the version of
               <i>xterm</i>, the cursor position and the time/date:

                   "%{version%}  %{position%}  %{unixtime%}"

               If a "%" marker does not match any of the three special tokens
               used in the default resource setting, <i>xterm</i> uses <b>strftime</b> to
               interpret it.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:initialFont" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:initialFont">initialFont</a></b> (class <b>InitialFont</b>)
               Specifies which of the VT100 fonts to use initially.  Values
               are the same as for the <b><a href="#Actions:set-vt-font">set-vt-font</a></b> action.  The default is
               "d", i.e., "default".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:inputMethod" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:inputMethod">inputMethod</a></b> (class <b>InputMethod</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> which type of input method to use.  There is no
               default method.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:internalBorder" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:internalBorder">internalBorder</a></b> (class <b>BorderWidth</b>)
               Specifies the number of pixels between the characters and the
               window border.  The default is "2".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:italicULMode" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:italicULMode">italicULMode</a></b> (class <b>ColorAttrMode</b>)
               Specifies whether characters with the underline attribute
               should be displayed in an italic font or as underlined
               characters.  It is implemented only for TrueType fonts.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:jumpScroll" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:jumpScroll">jumpScroll</a></b> (class <b>JumpScroll</b>)
               Specifies whether or not jump scroll should be used.  This
               corresponds to the VT102 DECSCLM private mode.  The default is
               "true".  See <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:fastScroll">fastScroll</a></b> for a variation.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:keepClipboard" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:keepClipboard">keepClipboard</a></b> (class <b>KeepClipboard</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> will reuse the selection data which it
               copied to the clipboard rather than asking the clipboard for
               its current contents when told to provide the selection.  The
               default is "false".

               If compiled into <i>xterm</i>, the menu entry <b>Keep Clipboard</b> allows
               you to change this at runtime.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:keepSelection" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:keepSelection">keepSelection</a></b> (class <b>KeepSelection</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> will keep the selection even after the
               selected area was touched by some output to the terminal.  The
               default is "true".

               The menu entry <b><a href="#VT-Options:Keep-Selection">Keep Selection</a></b> allows you to change this at
               runtime.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:keyboardDialect" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:keyboardDialect">keyboardDialect</a></b> (class <b>KeyboardDialect</b>)
               Specifies the initial keyboard dialect, as well as the default
               value when the terminal is reset.  The value given is the same
               as the final character in the control sequences which change
               character sets.  The default is "B", which corresponds to US
               ASCII.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:limitFontsets" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:limitFontsets">limitFontsets</a></b> (class <b>LimitFontsets</b>)
               Limits the number of TrueType fallback fonts (i.e., fontset)
               which can be tested.  The default is "50".  No more than "255"
               will be scanned.

               This limits the number of fallback fonts which <i>xterm</i> uses to
               display characters.  Because TrueType fonts typically are
               small, <i>xterm</i> may open several fonts for good coverage, and may
               open additional fonts to obtain information.  You can see which
               font-files <i>xterm</i> opens by setting the environment variable
               <b>XFT_DEBUG</b> to 3.  The Xft library and <i>xterm</i> write this debugging
               trace to the standard output.

               Set this to "0" to disable fallbacks entirely.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:limitFontHeight" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:limitFontHeight">limitFontHeight</a></b> (class <b>LimitFontHeight</b>)
               When scaling a TrueType font to provide the parts for a double-
               high character, <i>xterm</i> compares the scaled font with the
               original to ensure that it is taller.

               The default is "10" (percent).

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:limitFontWidth" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:limitFontWidth">limitFontWidth</a></b> (class <b>LimitFontWidth</b>)
               When looking for fallback fonts, <i>xterm</i> checks to see that the
               the character to be displayed is the same width as the primary
               font.  If a character extends outside the font's bounding box,
               <i>xterm</i> will clip it, to fit.

               This resource controls the amount by which the character can
               extend outside its bounding box before <i>xterm</i> looks further for
               a better font.

               This resource is also used in scaling TrueType fonts for
               double-wide characters, like <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:limitFontHeight">limitFontHeight</a></b> for double-wide
               characters.

               The default is "10" (percent).

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:limitResize" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:limitResize">limitResize</a></b> (class <b>LimitResize</b>)
               Limits resizing of the screen via control sequence to a given
               multiple of the display dimensions.  The default is "1".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:limitResponse" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:limitResponse">limitResponse</a></b> (class <b>LimitResponse</b>)
               Limits the buffer-size used when <i>xterm</i> replies to various
               control sequences.  The default is "1024".  The minimum value
               is "256".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:locale" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:locale">locale</a></b> (class <b>Locale</b>)
               Specifies how to use <i>luit</i>, an encoding converter between UTF-8
               and locale encodings.  The resource value (ignoring case) may
               be:

               <i>true</i>
                   <i>Xterm</i> will use the encoding specified by the users'
                   LC_CTYPE locale (i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG variables)
                   as far as possible.  This is realized by always enabling
                   UTF-8 mode and invoking <i>luit</i> in non-UTF-8 locales.

               <i>medium</i>
                   <i>Xterm</i> will follow users' LC_CTYPE locale only for UTF-8,
                   east Asian, and Thai locales, where the encodings were not
                   supported by conventional 8bit mode with changing fonts.
                   For other locales, <i>xterm</i> will use conventional 8bit mode.

               <i>checkfont</i>
                   If mini-luit is compiled-in, <i>xterm</i> will check if a Unicode
                   font has been specified.  If so, it checks if the character
                   encoding for the current locale is POSIX, Latin-1 or
                   Latin-9, uses the appropriate mapping to support those with
                   the Unicode font.  For other encodings, <i>xterm</i> assumes that
                   UTF-8 encoding is required.

               <i>false</i>
                   <i>Xterm</i> will use conventional 8bit mode or UTF-8 mode
                   according to <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b> resource or <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-u8">-u8</a></b> option.

               Any other value, e.g., "UTF-8" or "ISO8859-2", is assumed to be
               an encoding name; <i>luit</i> will be invoked to support the encoding.
               The actual list of supported encodings depends on <i>luit</i>.  The
               default is "medium".

               Regardless of your locale and encoding, you need an ISO-10646-1
               font to display the result.  Your configuration may not include
               this font, or locale-support by <i>xterm</i> may not be needed.

               At startup, <i>xterm</i> uses a mechanism equivalent to the
               <b>load-vt-fonts(utf8Fonts,</b> <b>Utf8Fonts)</b> action to load font name
               subresources of the VT100 widget.  That is, resource patterns
               such as "<b>*vt100.utf8Fonts.font</b>" will be loaded, and (if this
               resource is enabled), override the normal fonts.  If no
               subresources are found, the normal fonts such as "<b>*vt100.font</b>",
               etc., are used.

               For instance, you could have this in your resource file:

                   *VT100.font: 12x24
                   *VT100.utf8Fonts.font:9x15

               When started with a UTF-8 locale, <i>xterm</i> would use 9x15, but
               allow you to switch to the 12x24 font using the menu entry
               "<b><a href="#VT-Fonts:UTF-8-Fonts">UTF-8 Fonts</a></b>".

               The resource files distributed with <i>xterm</i> use ISO-10646-1
               fonts, but do not rely on them unless you are using the locale
               mechanism.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:localeFilter" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:localeFilter">localeFilter</a></b> (class <b>LocaleFilter</b>)
               Specifies the file name for the encoding converter from/to
               locale encodings and UTF-8 which is used with the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-lc">-lc</a></b> option or
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:locale">locale</a></b> resource.  The help message shown by "xterm -help" lists
               the default value, which depends on your system configuration.

               If the encoding converter requires command-line parameters, you
               can add those after the command, e.g.,

                   *localeFilter: xterm-filter -p

               Alternatively, you may put those parameters within a shell
               script to execute the converter, and set this resource to point
               to the shell script.

               When using a locale-filter, e.g., with the <i>-e</i> option, or the
               shell, <i>xterm</i> first tries passing control via that filter.  If
               it fails, <i>xterm</i> will retry without the locale-filter.  <i>Xterm</i>
               warns about the failure before retrying.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:logFile" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:logFile">logFile</a></b> (class <b>Logfile</b>)
               Specify the name for <i>xterm</i>'s log file.  If no name is
               specified, <i>xterm</i> will generate a name when logging is enabled,
               as described in the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-l">-l</a></b> option.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:logInhibit" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:logInhibit">logInhibit</a></b> (class <b>LogInhibit</b>)
               If "true", prevent the logging feature from being enabled,
               whether by the command-line option <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-l">-l</a></b>, or the menu entry <b><a href="#Main-Options:Log-to-File">Log to</a></b>
               <b><a href="#Main-Options:Log-to-File">File</a></b>.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:logging" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:logging">logging</a></b> (class <b>Logging</b>)
               If "true", (and if <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:logInhibit">logInhibit</a></b> is not set) enable the logging
               feature.  This resource is set/updated by the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-l">-l</a></b> option and the
               menu entry <b><a href="#Main-Options:Log-to-File">Log to File</a></b>.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:loginShell" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:loginShell">loginShell</a></b> (class <b>LoginShell</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the shell to be run in the window
               should be started as a login shell.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:marginBell" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:marginBell">marginBell</a></b> (class <b>MarginBell</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the bell should be rung when the user
               types near the right margin.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:maxGraphicSize" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:maxGraphicSize">maxGraphicSize</a></b> (class <b>MaxGraphicSize</b>)
               If <i>xterm</i> is configured to support ReGIS or SIXEL graphics, this
               resource controls the maximum size of a graph which can be
               displayed.

               The default is "1000x1000" (given as <i>width</i> by <i>height</i>).

               If the resource is "auto" then <i>xterm</i> will use the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:decGraphicsID">decGraphicsID</a></b>
               resource (or <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:decTerminalID">decTerminalID</a></b> if that is not set):

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:maxStringParse" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:maxStringParse">maxStringParse</a></b> (class <b>MaxStringParse</b>)
               <i>Xterm</i>'s state parser recognizes several types of control
               strings which can contain text, e.g.,

               <b>APC</b> (Application Program Command),
               <b>DCS</b> (Device Control String),
               <b>OSC</b> (Operating System Command),
               <b>PM</b> (Privacy Message), and
               <b>SOS</b> (Start of String),

               <i>Xterm</i> reads these strings, accumulating them into a buffer
               until they are properly terminated.  At that point, <i>xterm</i>
               interprets the strings.  If they happen to be <b>DCS</b> commands to
               draw ReGIS or SIXEL images, these strings may be large, in the
               hundreds of kilobytes.  A few <b>OSC</b> commands may be as large as
               10 kilobytes.

               This resource sets a limit on the size of the buffer used for
               these strings.  The default is "600000" based on the features
               which are configured for <i>xterm</i>.  Control strings which require
               larger buffer size are ignored.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:metaSendsEscape" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:metaSendsEscape">metaSendsEscape</a></b> (class <b>MetaSendsEscape</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> what to do with input-characters modified by <i>Meta</i>:

               <b>o</b>   If "true", Meta characters (a character combined with the
                   <i>Meta</i> modifier key) are converted into a two-character
                   sequence with the character itself preceded by ESC.  This
                   applies as well to function key control sequences, unless
                   <i>xterm</i> sees that <b>Meta</b> is used in your key translations.

               <b>o</b>   If "false", Meta characters input from the keyboard are
                   handled according to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitInput">eightBitInput</a></b> resource.

               The default is "False".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:mkSamplePass" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:mkSamplePass">mkSamplePass</a></b> (class <b>MkSamplePass</b>)

               false, on startup <i>xterm</i> compares its built-in tables to the
               system's wide character width data to decide if it will use the
               system's data.  It tests the first <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:mkSampleSize">mkSampleSize</a></b> character
               values, and allows up to <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:mkSamplePass">mkSamplePass</a></b> mismatches before the
               test fails.  The default (for the allowed number of mismatches)
               is 655 (one percent of the default value for <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:mkSampleSize">mkSampleSize</a></b>).

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:mkSampleSize" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:mkSampleSize">mkSampleSize</a></b> (class <b>MkSampleSize</b>)
               With <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:mkSamplePass">mkSamplePass</a></b>, this specifies a startup test used for
               initializing wide character width calculations.  The default
               (number of characters to check) is 65536.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:mkWidth" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:mkWidth">mkWidth</a></b> (class <b>MkWidth</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should use a built-in version of the

               resource which can override this.  The default is "false".

               Here is a summary of the resources which control the choice of
               wide character width calculation:

               <i>cjkWidth   mkWidth   Action</i>
               ---------------------------------------------------------------
               false      false     use system tables subject to <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:mkSamplePass">mkSamplePass</a></b>
               false      true      use built-in tables
               true       false     use built-in CJK tables
               true       true      use built-in CJK tables

               To disable <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:mkWidth">mkWidth</a></b>, and use the system's tables, set both
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:mkSampleSize">mkSampleSize</a></b> and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:mkSamplePass">mkSamplePass</a></b> to "0".  Doing that may make
               <i>xterm</i> more consistent with applications running in <i>xterm</i>, but
               may omit some font glyphs whose width correctly differs from
               the system's character tables.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:modifyCursorKeys" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:modifyCursorKeys">modifyCursorKeys</a></b> (class <b>ModifyCursorKeys</b>)
               Tells how to handle the special case where Control-, Shift-,
               Alt- or Meta-modifiers are used to add a parameter to the
               escape sequence returned by a cursor-key.  The default is "2":

               -1   disables the feature.

               0    uses the old/obsolete behavior, i.e., the modifier is the
                    first parameter.

               1    prefixes modified sequences with CSI.

               2    forces the modifier to be the second parameter if it would
                    otherwise be the first.

               3    marks the sequence with a "&gt;" to hint that it is private.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:modifyFunctionKeys" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:modifyFunctionKeys">modifyFunctionKeys</a></b> (class <b>ModifyFunctionKeys</b>)
               Tells how to handle the special case where Control-, Shift-,
               Alt- or Meta-modifiers are used to add a parameter to the
               escape sequence returned by a (numbered) function-key.  The
               default is "2".  The resource values are similar to
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:modifyCursorKeys">modifyCursorKeys</a></b>:

               -1   permits the user to use shift- and control-modifiers to
                    construct function-key strings using the normal encoding
                    scheme.

               0    uses the old/obsolete behavior, i.e., the modifier is the
                    first parameter.

               1    prefixes modified sequences with CSI.

               2    forces the modifier to be the second parameter if it would
                    otherwise be the first.

               3    marks the sequence with a "&gt;" to hint that it is private.

               If <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:modifyFunctionKeys">modifyFunctionKeys</a></b> is zero, <i>xterm</i> uses Control- and Shift-
               modifiers to allow the user to construct numbered function-keys
               beyond the set provided by the keyboard:

               Control
                    adds the value given by the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:ctrlFKeys">ctrlFKeys</a></b> resource.

               Shift
                    adds twice the value given by the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:ctrlFKeys">ctrlFKeys</a></b> resource.

               Control/Shift
                    adds three times the value given by the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:ctrlFKeys">ctrlFKeys</a></b>
                    resource.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:modifyKeyboard" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:modifyKeyboard">modifyKeyboard</a></b> (class <b>ModifyKeyboard</b>)
               Normally <i>xterm</i> makes a special case regarding modifiers (shift,
               control, etc.)  to handle special keyboard layouts (<b>legacy</b> and
               <b>vt220</b>).  This is done to provide compatible keyboards for DEC
               VT220 and related terminals that implement user-defined keys
               (UDK).

               The bits of the resource value selectively enable modification
               of the given category when these keyboards are selected.  The
               default is "0":

               0    The legacy/vt220 keyboards interpret only the Control-
                    modifier when constructing numbered function-keys.  Other
                    special keys are not modified.

               1    allows modification of the numeric keypad

               2    allows modification of the editing keypad

               4    allows modification of function-keys, overrides use of
                    Shift-modifier for UDK.

               8    allows modification of other special keys

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:modifyOtherKeys" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:modifyOtherKeys">modifyOtherKeys</a></b> (class <b>ModifyOtherKeys</b>)
               Like <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:modifyCursorKeys">modifyCursorKeys</a></b>, tells <i>xterm</i> to construct an escape
               sequence for <i>ordinary</i> (i.e., "other") keys (such as "2") when
               modified by Shift-, Control-, Alt- or Meta-modifiers.  This
               feature does not apply to <i>special keys</i>, i.e., cursor-, keypad-,
               function- or control-keys which are labeled on your keyboard.
               Those have key symbols which XKB identifies uniquely.

               For example, this feature does not apply to <i>special</i> control-
               keys (e.g., Escape, Tab, Enter, Backspace) Other control keys
               (e.g., Control-I, Control-M, Control-H) may send escape
               sequences when this feature is enabled.

               The default is "0":

               0    disables this feature.

               1    enables this feature for keys except for those with well-
                    known behavior, e.g., Tab, Backarrow and some special
                    control character cases which are built into the X11
                    library, e.g., Control-Space to make a NUL, or Control-3
                    to make an Escape character.

                    Except for those special cases built into the X11 library,
                    the Shift- and Control- modifiers are treated normally.
                    The Alt- and Meta- modifiers do not cause <i>xterm</i> to send
                    escape sequences.  Those modifier keys are interpreted
                    according to other resources, e.g., the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:metaSendsEscape">metaSendsEscape</a></b>
                    resource.

               2    enables this feature for keys including the exceptions
                    listed.  <i>Xterm</i> ignores the special cases built into the
                    X11 library.  Any shifted (modified) ordinary key sends an
                    escape sequence.  The Alt- and Meta- modifiers cause <i>xterm</i>
                    to send escape sequences.

               The <i>Xterm</i> FAQ has an extended discussion of this feature, with
               examples:

               <a href="/xterm/modified-keys.html">https://invisible-island.net/xterm/modified-keys.html</a>

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:multiClickTime" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:multiClickTime">multiClickTime</a></b> (class <b>MultiClickTime</b>)

               select events.  The default is "250" milliseconds.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:multiScroll" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:multiScroll">multiScroll</a></b> (class <b>MultiScroll</b>)
               Specifies whether or not scrolling should be done
               asynchronously.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:nMarginBell" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:nMarginBell">nMarginBell</a></b> (class <b>Column</b>)
               Specifies the number of characters from the right margin at
               which the margin bell should be rung, when enabled by the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:marginBell">marginBell</a></b> resource.  The default is "10".

       <i>name</i><b>Keymap</b> (class <i>Name</i><b>Keymap</b>)
               See the discussion of the <b><a href="#Actions:keymap">keymap</a></b><b>()</b> action.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:nextEventDelay" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:nextEventDelay">nextEventDelay</a></b> (class <b>NextEventDelay</b>)
               Specifies a delay time in milliseconds before checking for new
               X events.  The default is "1".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:numColorRegisters" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:numColorRegisters">numColorRegisters</a></b> (class <b>NumColorRegisters</b>)
               If <i>xterm</i> is configured to support ReGIS or SIXEL graphics, this
               specifies the number of color-registers which are available.

               If this resource is not specified, <i>xterm</i> uses a value
               determined by the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:decTerminalID">decTerminalID</a></b> resource:

               <b>Result   decTerminalID</b>

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:numLock" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:numLock">numLock</a></b> (class <b>NumLock</b>)
               If "true", <i>xterm</i> checks if NumLock is used as a modifier (see
               <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/xmodmap.1.xhtml"><b>xmodmap(1)</b></a>).  If so, this modifier is used to simplify the
               logic when implementing special NumLock for the <b><a href="#Application-Resources:sunKeyboard">sunKeyboard</a></b>
               resource.  Also (when <b><a href="#Application-Resources:sunKeyboard">sunKeyboard</a></b> is false), similar logic is
               used to find the modifier associated with the left and right
               Alt keys.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:oldXtermFKeys" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:oldXtermFKeys">oldXtermFKeys</a></b> (class <b>OldXtermFKeys</b>)
               If "true", <i>xterm</i> will use old-style (X11R5) escape sequences
               for function keys F1 to F4, for compatibility with X Consortium
               <i>xterm</i>.  Otherwise, it uses the VT100 codes for PF1 to PF4.  The
               default is "false".

               Setting this resource has the same effect as setting the
               <b><a href="#Application-Resources:keyboardType">keyboardType</a></b> to <b>legacy</b>.  The <b><a href="#Application-Resources:keyboardType">keyboardType</a></b> resource is the
               preferred mechanism for selecting this mode.

               The old-style escape sequences resemble VT220 keys, but appear
               to have been invented for <i>xterm</i> in X11R4.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:on2Clicks" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:on2Clicks">on2Clicks</a></b> (class <b>On2Clicks</b>)

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:on3Clicks" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:on3Clicks">on3Clicks</a></b> (class <b>On3Clicks</b>)

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:on4Clicks" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:on4Clicks">on4Clicks</a></b> (class <b>On4Clicks</b>)

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:on5Clicks" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:on5Clicks">on5Clicks</a></b> (class <b>On5Clicks</b>)
               Specify selection behavior in response to multiple mouse
               clicks.  A single mouse click is always interpreted as
               described in the <b><a href="#h3-Selection-Functions">Selection Functions</a></b> section (see <b><a href="#h2-POINTER-USAGE">POINTER</a></b>
               <b><a href="#h2-POINTER-USAGE">USAGE</a></b>).  Multiple mouse clicks (using the button which
               activates the <b><a href="#Actions:select-start">select-start</a></b> action) are interpreted according to
               the resource values of <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:on2Clicks">on2Clicks</a></b>, etc.  The resource value can
               be one of these:

               <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:word" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:word">word</a></b>
                  Select a "word" as determined by the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:charClass">charClass</a></b> resource.
                  See the <b><a href="#h2-CHARACTER-CLASSES">CHARACTER CLASSES</a></b> section.

                  If the pointer is on a "word" then <i>xterm</i> searches back to
                  the beginning of the word, and then to the end.

                  If the pointer is not on a "word" then the result depends on
                  whether it is on whitespace (including a newline), or past
                  the end of the line.  In the latter case <i>xterm</i> may select a
                  "word" beginning after the newline, if there is no
                  additional whitespace.

               <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:line" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:line">line</a></b>
                  Select a line (counting wrapping).

               <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:group" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:group">group</a></b>
                  Select a group of adjacent lines (counting wrapping).  The
                  selection stops on a blank line, and does not extend outside
                  the current page.

               <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:page" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:page">page</a></b>
                  Select all visible lines, i.e., the page.

               <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:all" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:all">all</a></b>
                  Select all lines, i.e., including the saved lines.

               <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:regex" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:regex">regex</a></b>
                  Select the best match for the POSIX extended regular
                  expression (ERE) which follows in the resource value:

                  <b>o</b>   <i>Xterm</i> matches the regular expression against a byte
                      array for the entire (possibly wrapped) line.  That byte
                      array may be UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1, depending on the mode
                      in which <i>xterm</i> is running.

                  <b>o</b>   <i>Xterm</i> steps through each byte-offset in this array,
                      keeping track of the best (longest) match.  If more than
                      one match ties for the longest length, the first is
                      used.

                      <i>Xterm</i> does this to make it convenient to click anywhere
                      in the area of interest and cause the regular expression
                      to match the entire word, etc.

                  <b>o</b>   The "^" and "$" anchors in a regular expression denote
                      the ends of the entire line.

                  <b>o</b>   If the regular expression contains backslashes "\" those
                      should be escaped "\\" because the X libraries interpret
                      backslashes in resource strings.

               <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:none" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:none">none</a></b>
                  No selection action is associated with this resource.  <i>Xterm</i>
                  interprets it as the end of the list.  For example, you may
                  use it to disable triple (and higher) clicking by setting
                  <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:on3Clicks">on3Clicks</a></b> to "none".

               The default values for <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:on2Clicks">on2Clicks</a></b> and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:on3Clicks">on3Clicks</a></b> are "word" and
               "line", respectively.  There is no default value for <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:on4Clicks">on4Clicks</a></b>
               or <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:on5Clicks">on5Clicks</a></b>, making those inactive.  On startup, <i>xterm</i>
               determines the maximum number of clicks by the <a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:on2Clicks"><b>on</b><i>X</i><b>Clicks</b></a>
               resource values which are set.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:openIm" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:openIm">openIm</a></b> (class <b>OpenIm</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> whether to open the input method at startup.  The
               default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:pointerColor" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:pointerColor">pointerColor</a></b> (class <b>PointerColor</b>)
               Specifies the foreground color of the pointer.  The default is

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:pointerColorBackground" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:pointerColorBackground">pointerColorBackground</a></b> (class <b>PointerColorBackground</b>)
               Specifies the background color of the pointer.  The default is

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:pointerFont" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:pointerFont">pointerFont</a></b> (class <b>PointerFont</b>)
               Specifies the font to be used for the pointer.  The shapes
               specified by <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:pointerShape">pointerShape</a></b> are glyphs in this font.  The

               Specifies when the pointer may be hidden as the user types.  It
               will be redisplayed if the user moves the mouse, or clicks one
               of its buttons.

               If you are using a <i>cursor theme</i>, expect it to provide about a
               third of those names, while adding others.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:popOnBell" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:popOnBell">popOnBell</a></b> (class <b>PopOnBell</b>)
               Specifies whether the window would be raised when Control-G is
               received.  The default is "false".

               If the window is iconified, this has no effect.  However, the
               <b><a href="#Application-Resources:zIconBeep">zIconBeep</a></b> resource provides you with the ability to see which
               iconified windows have sounded a bell.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:precompose" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:precompose">precompose</a></b> (class <b>Precompose</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> whether to precompose UTF-8 data into Normalization
               Form C, which combines commonly-used accents onto base
               characters.  If it does not do this, accents are left as
               separate characters.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:preeditType" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:preeditType">preeditType</a></b> (class <b>PreeditType</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> which types of preedit (preconversion) string to
               display.  The default is "OverTheSpot,Root".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printAttributes" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printAttributes">printAttributes</a></b> (class <b>PrintAttributes</b>)
               Specifies whether to print graphic attributes along with the
               text.  A real DEC VT<i>xxx</i> terminal will print the underline,
               highlighting codes but your printer may not handle these.

               <b>o</b>   "0" disables the attributes.

               <b>o</b>   "1" prints the normal set of attributes (bold, underline,
                   inverse and blink) as VT100-style control sequences.

               <b>o</b>   "2" prints ANSI color attributes as well.

               The default is "1".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printFileImmediate" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printFileImmediate">printFileImmediate</a></b> (class <b>PrintFileImmediate</b>)
               When the <b><a href="#Actions:print-immediate">print-immediate</a></b> action is invoked, <i>xterm</i> prints the
               screen contents directly to a file.  Set this resource to the
               prefix of the filename (a timestamp will be appended to the

               The default is an empty string, i.e., "", However, when the
               <b><a href="#Actions:print-immediate">print-immediate</a></b> action is invoked, if the string is empty, then
               "XTerm" is used.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printFileOnXError" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printFileOnXError">printFileOnXError</a></b> (class <b>PrintFileOnXError</b>)
               If <i>xterm</i> exits with an X error, e.g., your connection is broken
               when the server crashes, it can be told to write the contents
               of the screen to a file.  To enable the feature, set this
               resource to the prefix of the filename (a timestamp will be
               appended to the actual name).

               The default is an empty string, i.e., "", which disables this
               feature.  However, when the <b><a href="#Actions:print-on-error">print-on-error</a></b> action is invoked,
               if the string is empty, then "XTermError" is used.

               These error codes are handled: ERROR_XERROR, ERROR_XIOERROR and

               <i>Xterm</i> implements the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printFileOnXError">printFileOnXError</a></b> feature using the
               printer feature, although the output is written directly to a
               file.  You can use the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printModeOnXError">printModeOnXError</a></b> resource to tell it to
               use escape sequences to reconstruct the video attributes and
               colors.  This uses the same values as the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printAttributes">printAttributes</a></b>
               resource.  The default is "0".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printOptsImmediate" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printOptsImmediate">printOptsImmediate</a></b> (class <b>PrintOptsImmediate</b>)
               Specify the range of text which is printed to a file when the
               <b><a href="#Actions:print-immediate">print-immediate</a></b> action is invoked.

               <b>o</b>   If zero (0), then this selects the current (visible screen)
                   plus the saved lines, except if the alternate screen is
                   being used.  In that case, only the alternate screen is
                   selected.

               <b>o</b>   If nonzero, the bits of this resource value (checked in
                   descending order) select the range:

                   8  selects the saved lines.

                   4  selects the alternate screen.

                   2  selects the normal screen.

                   1  selects the current screen, which can be either the
                      normal or alternate screen.

               The default is "9", which selects the current visible screen
               plus saved lines, with no special case for the alternated
               screen.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printOptsOnXError" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printOptsOnXError">printOptsOnXError</a></b> (class <b>PrintOptsOnXError</b>)

               <b><a href="#Actions:print-on-error">print-on-error</a></b> action is invoked.  The resource value is
               interpreted the same as in <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printOptsImmediate">printOptsImmediate</a></b>.

               The default is "9", which selects the current visible screen
               plus saved lines, with no special case for the alternated
               screen.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printerAutoClose" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printerAutoClose">printerAutoClose</a></b> (class <b>PrinterAutoClose</b>)
               If "true", <i>xterm</i> will close the printer (a pipe) when the
               application switches the printer offline with a Media Copy
               command.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printerCommand" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printerCommand">printerCommand</a></b> (class <b>PrinterCommand</b>)
               Specifies a shell command to which <i>xterm</i> will open a pipe when
               the first MC (Media Copy) command is initiated.  The default is
               an empty string, i.e., "".  If the resource value is given as
               an empty string, the printer is disabled.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printerControlMode" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printerControlMode">printerControlMode</a></b> (class <b>PrinterControlMode</b>)
               Specifies the printer control mode.  A "1" selects autoprint
               mode, which causes <i>xterm</i> to print a line from the screen when

               <b>o</b>   you move the cursor off that line with a line feed, form
                   feed or vertical tab character, or

               <b>o</b>   an autowrap occurs.

               Autoprint mode is overridden by printer controller mode (a
               "2"), which causes all of the output to be directed to the
               printer.  The default is "0".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printerExtent" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printerExtent">printerExtent</a></b> (class <b>PrinterExtent</b>)
               Controls whether a print page function will print the entire
               page (true), or only the portion within the scrolling margins
               (false).  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printerFormFeed" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printerFormFeed">printerFormFeed</a></b> (class <b>PrinterFormFeed</b>)
               Controls whether a form feed is sent to the printer at the end
               of a print page function.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:printerNewLine" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:printerNewLine">printerNewLine</a></b> (class <b>PrinterNewLine</b>)
               Controls whether a newline is sent to the printer at the end of
               a print page function.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:privateColorRegisters" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:privateColorRegisters">privateColorRegisters</a></b> (class <b>PrivateColorRegisters</b>)
               If <i>xterm</i> is configured to support ReGIS or SIXEL graphics, this
               controls whether <i>xterm</i> allocates separate color registers for
               each sixel device control string, e.g., for DECGCI.  If not
               true, color registers are allocated only once, when the
               terminal is reset, and color changes  in  any  graphic  affect
               all graphics.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:quietGrab" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:quietGrab">quietGrab</a></b> (class <b>QuietGrab</b>)
               Controls whether the cursor is repainted when <i>NotifyGrab</i> and
               <i>NotifyUngrab</i> event types are received during change of focus.
               The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:regisDefaultFont" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:regisDefaultFont">regisDefaultFont</a></b> (class <b>RegisDefaultFont</b>)
               If <i>xterm</i> is configured to support ReGIS graphics, this resource
               tells <i>xterm</i> which font to use if the ReGIS data does not
               specify one.  No default value is specified; <i>xterm</i> accepts a
               TrueType font specification as in the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> resource.

               If no value is specified, <i>xterm</i> draws a bitmap indicating a
               missing character.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:regisScreenSize" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:regisScreenSize">regisScreenSize</a></b> (class <b>RegisScreenSize</b>)
               If <i>xterm</i> is configured to support ReGIS graphics, this resource
               tells <i>xterm</i> the default size (in pixels) for these graphics,
               which also sets the default coordinate space to [0,0] (upper-
               left) and [<i>width</i>,<i>height</i>] (lower-right).

               The application using ReGIS may use the "A" option of the "S"
               command to adjust the coordinate space or change the
               addressable portion of the screen.

               <i>Xterm</i> accepts a special resource value "auto", which tells
               <i>xterm</i> to use the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:decGraphicsID">decGraphicsID</a></b> and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:decTerminalID">decTerminalID</a></b> resources to
               set the default size based on the hardware terminal's limits.
               Those limits are the same as for the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:maxGraphicSize">maxGraphicSize</a></b> resource.

               The default is "auto".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:renderFont" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:renderFont">renderFont</a></b> (class <b>RenderFont</b>)
               If <i>xterm</i> is built with the Xft library, this controls whether
               the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> resource is used.  The default is "default".

               The resource values are strings, evaluated as booleans after
               startup.

               false
                    disable the feature and use the normal (bitmap) font.

               true
                    startup using the TrueType font specified by the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b>
                    and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceSize">faceSize</a></b> resource settings.  If there is no value for
                    <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b>, disable the feature and use the normal (bitmap)
                    font.

                    After startup, you can still switch to/from the bitmap
                    font using the "TrueType Fonts" menu entry.

               default
                    Enable the "TrueType Fonts" menu entry to allow runtime
                    switching to/from TrueType fonts.  The initial font used
                    depends upon whether the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> resource is set:

                    <b>o</b>   If the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> resource is not set, start by using
                        the normal (bitmap) font.  <i>Xterm</i> has a separate
                        compiled-in value for <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> for this special case.
                        That is normally "mono".

                    <b>o</b>   If the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> resource is set, then start by using
                        the TrueType font rather than the bitmap font.

               defaultOff
                    Enable the "TrueType Fonts" menu entry to allow runtime
                    switching to/from TrueType fonts, but allow it to be
                    initially unselected if no <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:faceName">faceName</a></b> resource was given.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:resizeByPixel" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:resizeByPixel">resizeByPixel</a></b> (class <b>ResizeByPixel</b>)
               Set this "true" to disable hints to the window manager that
               request resizing by character rather than pixels.

               Most window managers provide visual feedback showing the size
               of a window as you resize it, using these hints.  When you
               maximize <i>xterm</i>, it disables those hints to allow the window
               manager to make better use of fractional rows or columns.
               Setting this resource disables the hints all the time.

               The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:resizeGravity" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:resizeGravity">resizeGravity</a></b> (class <b>ResizeGravity</b>)
               Affects the behavior when the window is resized to be taller or
               shorter.  <b>NorthWest</b> specifies that the top line of text on the
               screen stay fixed.  If the window is made shorter, lines are
               dropped from the bottom; if the window is made taller, blank
               lines are added at the bottom.  This is compatible with the
               behavior in X11R4.  <b>SouthWest</b> (the default) specifies that the
               bottom line of text on the screen stay fixed.  If the window is
               made taller, additional saved lines will be scrolled down onto
               the screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will be
               scrolled off the top of the screen, and the top saved lines
               will be dropped.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:retryInputMethod" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:retryInputMethod">retryInputMethod</a></b> (class <b>RetryInputMethod</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> how many times to retry, in case the input-method
               server is not responding.  This is a different issue than
               unsupported preedit type, etc.  You may encounter retries if
               your X configuration (and its libraries) are missing pieces.
               Setting this resource to zero "0" will cancel the retrying.
               The default is "3".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:reverseVideo" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:reverseVideo">reverseVideo</a></b> (class <b>ReverseVideo</b>)
               Specifies whether or not reverse video should be simulated.
               The default is "false".

               There are several aspects to reverse video in <i>xterm</i>:

               <b>o</b>   The command-line <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-rv">-rv</a></b> option tells the X libraries to
                   reverse the foreground and background colors.  <i>Xterm</i>'s
                   command-line options set resource values.  In particular,
                   the <i>X Toolkit</i> sets the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:reverseVideo">reverseVideo</a></b> resource when the <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-rv">-rv</a></b>
                   option is used.

               <b>o</b>   If the user has also used command-line options <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-fg">-fg</a></b> or <b><a href="#X-Toolkit-Options:-bg">-bg</a></b>
                   to set the foreground and background colors, <i>xterm</i> does not
                   see these options directly.  Instead, it examines the
                   resource values to reconstruct the command-line options,
                   and determine which of the colors is the user's intended
                   foreground, etc.  Their actual values are irrelevant to the
                   reverse video function; some users prefer the X defaults
                   (black text on a white background), others prefer white
                   text on a black background.

               <b>o</b>   After startup, the user can toggle the "Enable Reverse
                   Video" menu entry.  This exchanges the current foreground
                   and background colors of the VT100 widget, and repaints the
                   screen.  Because of the X resource hierarchy, the
                   <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:reverseVideo">reverseVideo</a></b> resource applies to more than the VT100
                   widget.

               Programs running in an <i>xterm</i> can also use control sequences to
               enable the VT100 reverse video mode.  These are independent of
               the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:reverseVideo">reverseVideo</a></b> resource and the menu entry.  <i>Xterm</i> exchanges
               the current foreground and background colors when drawing text
               affected by these control sequences.

               Other control sequences can alter the foreground and background
               colors which are used:

               <b>o</b>   Programs can also use the ANSI color control sequences to
                   set the foreground and background colors.

               <b>o</b>   Extensions to the ANSI color controls (such as 16-, 88- or
                   256-colors) are treated similarly to the ANSI control.

               <b>o</b>   Using other control sequences (the "<i>dynamic colors</i>"
                   feature), a program can change the foreground and
                   background colors.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:reverseWrap" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:reverseWrap">reverseWrap</a></b> (class <b>ReverseWrap</b>)
               Specifies whether or not reverse-wraparound should be enabled.
               This corresponds to <i>xterm</i>'s private mode 45.  The default is
               "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:rightScrollBar" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:rightScrollBar">rightScrollBar</a></b> (class <b>RightScrollBar</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the scrollbar should be displayed on
               the right rather than the left.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:saveLines" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:saveLines">saveLines</a></b> (class <b>SaveLines</b>)
               Specifies the number of lines to save beyond the top of the
               screen when a scrollbar is turned on.  The default is "1024".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:scrollBar" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:scrollBar">scrollBar</a></b> (class <b>ScrollBar</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the scrollbar should be displayed.
               The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:scrollBarBorder" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:scrollBarBorder">scrollBarBorder</a></b> (class <b>ScrollBarBorder</b>)
               Specifies the width of the scrollbar border.  Note that this is
               drawn to overlap the border of the <i>xterm</i> window.  Modifying the
               scrollbar's border affects only the line between the VT100
               widget and the scrollbar.  The default value is 1.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:scrollKey" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:scrollKey">scrollKey</a></b> (class <b>ScrollCond</b>)
               Specifies whether or not pressing a key should automatically
               cause the scrollbar to go to the bottom of the scrolling
               region.  This corresponds to <i>xterm</i>'s private mode 1011.  The
               default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:scrollLines" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:scrollLines">scrollLines</a></b> (class <b>ScrollLines</b>)
               Specifies the number of lines that the <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-back">scroll-back</a></b> and
               <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-forw">scroll-forw</a></b> actions should use as a default.  The default value
               is 1.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:scrollTtyOutput" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:scrollTtyOutput">scrollTtyOutput</a></b> (class <b>ScrollCond</b>)
               Specifies whether or not output to the terminal should
               automatically cause the scrollbar to go to the bottom of the
               scrolling region.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:selectToClipboard" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:selectToClipboard">selectToClipboard</a></b> (class <b>SelectToClipboard</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> whether to use the <b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b> or <b><a href="#h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></b> for <b><a href="#h3-SELECT">SELECT</a></b>
               tokens in the selection mechanism.  The <b><a href="#Actions:set-select">set-select</a></b> action can
               change this at runtime, allowing the user to work with programs
               that handle only one of these mechanisms.  The default is
               "false", which tells it to use <b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b>.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:shiftEscape" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:shiftEscape">shiftEscape</a></b> (class <b>ShiftEscape</b>)
               <i>Xterm</i> uses the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> resource to determine how to invoke
               actions for selecting and copying text using the pointer (e.g.,
               a mouse).  It also provides a mouse protocol which can be used
               by applications running in an xterm to detect mouse button
               clicks.

               The mouse protocol causes <i>xterm</i> to send special escape
               sequences which allow an application to determine if <i>modifiers</i>
               (i.e., one or more of <i>shift</i>, <i>control</i>, <i>alt</i>, and <i>meta</i>) were used.

               <i>Xterm</i> provides this mouse protocol by interpreting button- and
               motion-events in the functions which the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> resource
               calls for selecting and copying text:

                      <b><a href="#Actions:insert-selection">insert-selection</a></b>
                      <b><a href="#Actions:select-end">select-end</a></b>
                      <b><a href="#Actions:select-extend">select-extend</a></b>
                      <b><a href="#Actions:select-start">select-start</a></b>
                      <b><a href="#Actions:start-extend">start-extend</a></b>

               While the mouse protocol is active, <i>xterm</i> reserves most of the
               mouse button events for sending special escape sequences to the
               application.  <i>Xterm</i> normally allows you to use the <i>shift</i>-key to
               temporarily override this mouse protocol, permitting the
               selection and copying actions to be used.

               The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:shiftEscape">shiftEscape</a></b> resource setting allows you to tell <i>xterm</i>
               whether to use the <i>shift</i>-key in this way (i.e., overriding the
               mouse protocol).  <i>Xterm</i> accepts either a keyword (ignoring
               case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  Mouse protocol does not send special escapes when <i>shift</i>-key
                  is used.

               true (1)
                  Mouse protocol may send special escapes when <i>shift</i>-key is
                  used.

                  At startup, <i>xterm</i> analyzes the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> to see which
                  buttons are used in the (mouse) button-related bindings for
                  selection and copying text.  If the <i>shift</i>-key is not
                  mentioned explicitly in a button's binding, <i>xterm</i> allows
                  that button with <i>shift</i>-key for overriding the mouse
                  protocol.

               always (2)
                  Mouse protocol can always send special escapes when <i>shift</i>-
                  key is used.

               never (3)
                  Mouse protocol will never send special escapes when <i>shift</i>-
                  key is used.

               <i>Xterm</i> interprets a control sequence which can change this
               setting between "true" and "false".  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:shiftFonts" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:shiftFonts">shiftFonts</a></b> (class <b>ShiftFonts</b>)
               Specifies whether to enable the actions <b><a href="#Actions:larger-vt-font">larger-vt-font</a></b><b>()</b> and
               <b><a href="#Actions:smaller-vt-font">smaller-vt-font</a></b><b>()</b>, which are normally bound to the shifted
               KP_Add and KP_Subtract.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:showBlinkAsBold" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:showBlinkAsBold">showBlinkAsBold</a></b> (class <b>ShowBlinkAsBold</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> whether to display text with blink-attribute the
               same as bold.  If <i>xterm</i> has not been configured to support
               blinking text, the default is "true", which corresponds to
               older versions of <i>xterm</i>, otherwise the default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:showMissingGlyphs" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:showMissingGlyphs">showMissingGlyphs</a></b> (class <b>ShowMissingGlyphs</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> whether to display a box outlining places where a
               character has been used that the font does not represent.  The
               default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:showWrapMarks" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:showWrapMarks">showWrapMarks</a></b> (class <b>ShowWrapMarks</b>)
               For debugging <i>xterm</i> and applications that may manipulate the
               wrapped-line flag by writing text at the right margin, show a
               mark on the right inner-border of the window.  The mark shows
               which lines have the flag set.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:signalInhibit" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:signalInhibit">signalInhibit</a></b> (class <b>SignalInhibit</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the entries in the <b><a href="#h3-Main-Options">Main Options</a></b> menu
               for sending signals to <i>xterm</i> should be disallowed.  The default
               is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:sixelScrolling" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:sixelScrolling">sixelScrolling</a></b> (class <b>SixelScrolling</b>)
               If <i>xterm</i> is configured to support SIXEL graphics, this resource
               tells it whether to scroll up one line at a time when sixels
               would be written past the bottom line on the window.  The
               default is "true" which enables scrolling.

               Sixel scrolling is the opposite of DEC Sixel Display Mode
               (DECSDM): when one is on, the other is off.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:sixelScrollsRight" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:sixelScrollsRight">sixelScrollsRight</a></b> (class <b>SixelScrollsRight</b>)
               If <i>xterm</i> is configured to support SIXEL graphics, this resource
               tells it whether to scroll to the right as needed to keep the
               current position visible rather than truncate the plot on the
               on the right.  The default is "false" which disables scrolling.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:tekGeometry" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:tekGeometry">tekGeometry</a></b> (class <b>Geometry</b>)
               Specifies the preferred size and position of the Tektronix
               window.  There is no default for this resource.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:tekInhibit" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:tekInhibit">tekInhibit</a></b> (class <b>TekInhibit</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the escape sequence to enter Tektronix
               mode should be ignored.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:tekSmall" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:tekSmall">tekSmall</a></b> (class <b>TekSmall</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the Tektronix mode window should start
               in its smallest size if no explicit geometry is given.  This is
               useful when running <i>xterm</i> on displays with small screens.  The
               default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:tekStartup" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:tekStartup">tekStartup</a></b> (class <b>TekStartup</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <i>xterm</i> should start up in Tektronix
               mode.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:tiXtraScroll" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:tiXtraScroll">tiXtraScroll</a></b> (class <b>TiXtraScroll</b>)
               Specifies whether <i>xterm</i> should scroll to a new page when
               processing the <i>ti</i> or <i>te</i> termcap strings, i.e., the private
               modes 47, 1047 or 1049.  This is only in effect if <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:titeInhibit">titeInhibit</a></b>
               is "true", because the intent of this option is to provide a
               picture of the full-screen application's display on the
               scrollback without wiping out the text that would be shown
               before the application was initialized.

               <i>Xterm</i> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number
               shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      nothing is added to the scrollback.

               true (1)
                      the current screen is added to the scrollback.

               trim (2)
                      the current screen is added to the scrollback, but
                      repeated blank lines are trimmed (reduced to a single
                      blank line).

               The default for this resource is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:titeInhibit" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:titeInhibit">titeInhibit</a></b> (class <b>TiteInhibit</b>)
               Originally specified whether or not <i>xterm</i> should remove <i>ti</i> and
               <i>te</i> termcap entries (used to switch between alternate screens on
               startup of many screen-oriented programs) from the TERMCAP
               string.

               TERMCAP is used rarely now, but <i>xterm</i> supports the feature on
               modern systems:

               <b>o</b>   If set, <i>xterm</i> also ignores the escape sequence to switch to
                   the alternate screen.

               <b>o</b>   <i>Xterm</i> supports terminfo in a different way, supporting
                   composite control sequences (also known as private modes)
                   1047, 1048 and 1049 which have the same effect as the
                   original 47 control sequence.

               The default for this resource is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:titleModes" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:titleModes">titleModes</a></b> (class <b>TitleModes</b>)
               Tells <i>xterm</i> whether to accept or return window- and icon-labels
               in ISO-8859-1 (the default) or UTF-8.  Either can be encoded in
               hexadecimal:

               <b>o</b>   UTF-8 titles require special treatment, because they may
                   contain bytes which can be mistaken for control characters.
                   Hexadecimal-encoding is supported to eliminate that
                   possibility.

               <b>o</b>   As an alternative, you could use the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:allowC1Printable">allowC1Printable</a></b>
                   resource, which suppresses <i>xterm</i>'s parsing of the relevant
                   control characters (and as a result, treats those bytes as
                   data).

               The default for this resource is "0".

               Each bit (bit "0" is 1, bit "1" is 2, etc.)  corresponds to one
               of the parameters set by the title modes control sequence:

               0    Set window/icon labels using hexadecimal

               1    Query window/icon labels using hexadecimal

               2    Set window/icon labels using UTF-8 (gives the same effect
                    as the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8Title">utf8Title</a></b> resource).

               3    Query window/icon labels using UTF-8

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:translations" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> (class <b>Translations</b>)
               Specifies the key and button bindings for menus, selections,
               "programmed strings", etc.  The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> resource, which
               provides much of <i>xterm</i>'s configurability, is a feature of the <i>X</i>
               <i>Toolkit Intrinsics</i> library (<a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xtoolkit/xtoolkit.html"><b>Xt</b></a>).  See the <b><a href="#h3-Actions">Actions</a></b> section.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:trimSelection" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:trimSelection">trimSelection</a></b> (class <b>TrimSelection</b>)
               If you set <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:highlightSelection">highlightSelection</a></b>, you can see the text which is
               selected, including any trailing spaces.  Clearing the screen
               (or a line) resets it to a state containing no spaces.  Some
               lines may contain trailing spaces when an application writes
               them to the screen.  However, you may not wish to paste lines
               with trailing spaces.  If this resource is true, <i>xterm</i> will
               trim trailing spaces from text which is selected.  It does not
               affect spaces which result in a wrapped line, nor will it trim
               the trailing newline from your selection.  The default is
               "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:underLine" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:underLine">underLine</a></b> (class <b>UnderLine</b>)
               This specifies whether or not text with the underline attribute
               should be underlined.  It may be desirable to disable
               underlining when color is being used for the underline
               attribute.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:useBorderClipping" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:useBorderClipping">useBorderClipping</a></b> (class <b>UseBorderClipping</b>)
               Tell <i>xterm</i> whether to apply clipping when <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:useClipping">useClipping</a></b> is false.
               Unlike <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:useClipping">useClipping</a></b>, this simply limits text to keep it within
               the window borders, e.g., as a refinement to the <b><a href="#Application-Resources:scaleHeight">scaleHeight</a></b>
               workaround.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:useClipping" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:useClipping">useClipping</a></b> (class <b>UseClipping</b>)
               Tell <i>xterm</i> whether to use clipping to keep from producing dots
               outside the text drawing area.  Originally used to work around
               for overstriking effects, this is also needed to work with some
               incorrectly-sized fonts.  The default is "true".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:utf8" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b> (class <b>Utf8</b>)
               This specifies whether <i>xterm</i> will run in UTF-8 mode.  If you
               set this resource, <i>xterm</i> also sets the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:wideChars">wideChars</a></b> resource as a
               side-effect.  The resource can be set via the menu entry "UTF-8
               Encoding".  The default is "default".

               <i>Xterm</i> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number
               shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  UTF-8 mode is initially off.  The command-line option <b><a href="#OPTIONS:_u8">+u8</a></b>
                  sets the resource to this value.  Escape sequences for
                  turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

               true (1)
                  UTF-8 mode is initially on.  Escape sequences for turning
                  UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

               always (2)
                  The command-line option <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-u8">-u8</a></b> sets the resource to this value.
                  Escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are ignored.

               default (3)
                  This is the default value of the resource.  It is changed
                  during initialization depending on whether the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:locale">locale</a></b>
                  resource was set, to false (0) or always (2).  See the
                  <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:locale">locale</a></b> resource for additional discussion of non-UTF-8
                  locales.

               If you want to set the value of <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b>, it should be in this
               range.  Other nonzero values are treated the same as "1", i.e.,
               UTF-8 mode is initially on, and escape sequences for turning
               UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:utf8Fonts" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8Fonts">utf8Fonts</a></b> (class <b>Utf8Fonts</b>)
               See the discussion of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:locale">locale</a></b> resource.  This specifies
               whether <i>xterm</i> will use UTF-8 fonts specified via resource
               patterns such as "<b>*vt100.utf8Fonts.font</b>" or normal (ISO-8859-1)
               fonts via patterns such as "<b>*vt100.font</b>".  The resource can be
               set via the menu entry "<b><a href="#VT-Fonts:UTF-8-Fonts">UTF-8 Fonts</a></b>".  The default is
               "default".

               <i>Xterm</i> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number
               shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      Use the ISO-8859-1 fonts.  The menu entry is enabled,
                      allowing the choice of fonts to be changed at runtime.

               true (1)
                      Use the UTF-8 fonts.  The menu entry is enabled,
                      allowing the choice of fonts to be changed at runtime.

               always (2)
                      Always use the UTF-8 fonts.  This also disables the menu
                      entry.

               default (3)
                      At startup, the resource is set to true or false,
                      according to the effective value of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:utf8Latin1" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8Latin1">utf8Latin1</a></b> (class <b>Utf8Latin1</b>)
               If true, allow an ISO-8859-1 <i>normal</i> font to be combined with an

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:utf8SelectTypes" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8SelectTypes">utf8SelectTypes</a></b> (class <b>Utf8SelectTypes</b>)
               Override <i>xterm</i>'s default selection target list (see
               <b><a href="#h2-SELECT_PASTE">SELECT/PASTE</a></b>) for selections in wide-character (UTF-8) mode.
               The default is an empty string, i.e., "", which does not
               override anything.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:utf8Title" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8Title">utf8Title</a></b> (class <b>Utf8Title</b>)
               Applications can set <i>xterm</i>'s title by writing a control
               sequence.  Normally this control sequence follows the VT220
               convention, which encodes the string in ISO-8859-1 and allows
               for an 8-bit string terminator.  If <i>xterm</i> is started in a UTF-8
               locale, it translates the ISO-8859-1 string to UTF-8 to work
               with the X libraries which assume the string is UTF-8.

               However, some users may wish to write a title string encoded in
               UTF-8.  The window manager is responsible for drawing window
               titles.  Some window managers (not all) support UTF-8 encoding
               of window titles.  Set this resource to "true" to also set
               UTF-8 encoded title strings using the EWMH properties.

               This feature is available as a menu entry, since it is related
               to the particular applications you are running within <i>xterm</i>.
               You can also use a control sequence (see the discussion of
               "Title Modes" in <i>Xterm Control Sequences</i>), to set an equivalent
               flag (which can also be set using the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:titleModes">titleModes</a></b> resource).

               <i>Xterm</i> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number
               shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      Set only ISO-8859-1 title strings, e.g., using the ICCCM
                      <b><a href="#Properties-set-by-X-Toolkit:WM_NAME">WM_NAME</a></b> STRING property.  The menu entry is enabled,
                      allowing the choice of title-strings to be changed at
                      runtime.

               true (1)
                      Set both the EWMH (UTF-8 strings) and the ICCCM <b><a href="#Properties-set-by-X-Toolkit:WM_NAME">WM_NAME</a></b>,
                      etc.  The menu entry is enabled, allowing the choice to
                      be changed at runtime.

               always (2)
                      Always set both the EWMH (UTF-8 strings) and the ICCCM
                      <b><a href="#Properties-set-by-X-Toolkit:WM_NAME">WM_NAME</a></b>, etc.  This also disables the menu entry.

               default (3)
                      At startup, the resource is set to true or false,
                      according to the effective value of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b> resource.

               The default is "default".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:utf8Weblike" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8Weblike">utf8Weblike</a></b> (class <b>Utf8Weblike</b>)
               Provide an alternate error-handling scheme for ill-formed UTF-8
               as recommended in a W3C document.  The Unicode standard does
               not require this for conformance.  Some additional information
               can be found here:

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:veryBoldColors" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:veryBoldColors">veryBoldColors</a></b> (class <b>VeryBoldColors</b>)
               Specifies whether to combine video attributes with colors
               specified by <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:colorBD">colorBD</a></b>, <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:colorBL">colorBL</a></b>, <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:colorIT">colorIT</a></b>, <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:colorRV">colorRV</a></b>, and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:colorUL">colorUL</a></b>.
               The resource value is the sum of values for each attribute:
                 1 for reverse,
                 2 for underline,
                 4 for bold,
                 8 for blink, and
                 512 for italic

               The default is "0".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:visualBell" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:visualBell">visualBell</a></b> (class <b>VisualBell</b>)
               Specifies whether or not a visible bell (i.e., flashing) should
               be used instead of an audible bell when Control-G is received.
               The default is "false", which tells <i>xterm</i> to use an audible
               bell.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:visualBellDelay" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:visualBellDelay">visualBellDelay</a></b> (class <b>VisualBellDelay</b>)
               Number of milliseconds to delay when displaying a visual bell.
               Default is 100.  If set to zero, no visual bell is displayed.
               This is useful for very slow displays, e.g., an LCD display on
               a laptop.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:visualBellLine" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:visualBellLine">visualBellLine</a></b> (class <b>VisualBellLine</b>)
               Specifies whether to flash only the current line when
               displaying a visual bell rather than flashing the entire
               screen: The default is "false", which tells <i>xterm</i> to flash the
               entire screen.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:vt100Graphics" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:vt100Graphics">vt100Graphics</a></b> (class <b>VT100Graphics</b>)
               This specifies whether <i>xterm</i> will interpret VT100 graphic
               character escape sequences while in UTF-8 mode.  This feature
               also applies to code-pages (e.g., for VT320 and VT520) and
               National Replacement Character Sets (VT220 and up), but not US-
               ASCII (the initially selected character set), to avoid conflict
               with UTF-8.  The default is "true", to provide support for
               various legacy applications.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:wideBoldFont" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:wideBoldFont">wideBoldFont</a></b> (class <b>WideBoldFont</b>)
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying bold
               wide text.  By default, it will attempt to use a font twice as
               wide as the font that will be used to draw bold text.  If no
               double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
               the bold font.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:wideChars" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:wideChars">wideChars</a></b> (class <b>WideChars</b>)
               Specifies if <i>xterm</i> should respond to control sequences that
               process 16-bit characters.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:wideFont" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:wideFont">wideFont</a></b> (class <b>WideFont</b>)
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying wide
               text.  By default, it will attempt to use a font twice as wide
               as the font that will be used to draw normal text.  If no
               double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
               the normal font.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:xftMaxGlyphMemory" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:xftMaxGlyphMemory">xftMaxGlyphMemory</a></b> (class <b>XftMaxGlyphMemory</b>)
               Set the Xft library's limit on glyph memory (typically 4Mb).
               When it reaches this limit, it discards "randomly chosen"
               glyphs to make room for new ones.  The default is "0" to use
               Xft's default value.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:xftMaxUnrefFonts" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:xftMaxUnrefFonts">xftMaxUnrefFonts</a></b> (class <b>XftMaxUnrefFonts</b>)
               Set the Xft library's limit on fonts which have been loaded
               (typically 16), e.g., matching patterns for fallback searches,
               but are not actually used.  The default is "0" to use Xft's
               default value.

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:xftTrackMemUsage" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:xftTrackMemUsage">xftTrackMemUsage</a></b> (class <b>XftTrackMemUsage</b>)
               Enables glyph memory tracking (introduced in Xft 2.3.5), which
               allows Xft to efficiently discard obsolete data when running
               short of memory.  The default is "false".

       <b><a title="VT100 Widget Resources:ximFont" name="VT100-Widget-Resources:ximFont">ximFont</a></b> (class <b>XimFont</b>)
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying the
               preedit string in the "OverTheSpot" input method.

               In "OverTheSpot" preedit type, the preedit (preconversion)
               string is displayed at the position of the cursor.  It is the
               XIM server's responsibility to display the preedit string.  The
               XIM client must inform the XIM server of the cursor position.
               For best results, the preedit string must be displayed with a
               proper font.  Therefore, <i>xterm</i> informs the XIM server of the
               proper font.  The font is be supplied by a "fontset", whose
               default value is "*".  This matches every font, the X library
               automatically chooses fonts with proper charsets.  The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:ximFont">ximFont</a></b>
               resource is provided to override this default font setting.

<h3><a name="h3-Scrollbar-Resources" id="h3-Scrollbar-Resources">Scrollbar Resources</a></h3>
<pre>       The following resources are useful when specified for the <i>Athena</i>
       Scrollbar widget:

       <b><a title="Scrollbar Resources:background" name="Scrollbar-Resources:background">background</a></b> (class <b>Background</b>)
               Specifies the color to use for the background of the scrollbar.

       <b><a title="Scrollbar Resources:foreground" name="Scrollbar-Resources:foreground">foreground</a></b> (class <b>Foreground</b>)
               Specifies the color to use for the foreground of the scrollbar.

       <b><a title="Scrollbar Resources:thickness" name="Scrollbar-Resources:thickness">thickness</a></b> (class <b>Thickness</b>)
               Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar (default: 14).

               This may be overridden by the <b><a href="#Scrollbar-Resources:width">width</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="Scrollbar Resources:thumb" name="Scrollbar-Resources:thumb">thumb</a></b> (class <b>Thumb</b>)
               The default "thumb" pixmap used for the scrollbar is a simple
               checkerboard pattern alternating pixels for foreground and
               background color.

       <b><a title="Scrollbar Resources:width" name="Scrollbar-Resources:width">width</a></b> (class <b>Width</b>)
               Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar (default: 0).

               The widget checks the <i>width</i> resource first, using the <i>thickness</i>
               value if the <i>width</i> is zero.

</pre>
<h2><a name="h2-POINTER-USAGE" id="h2-POINTER-USAGE">POINTER USAGE</a></h2>
<pre>       Once the VT<i>xxx</i> window is created, <i>xterm</i> allows you to select text and
       copy it within the same or other windows using the <i>pointer</i> or the
       keyboard.

       A "pointer" could be a mouse, touchpad or similar device.  X
       applications generally do not care, since they see only <i>button events</i>
       which have

       <b>o</b>   position and

       <b>o</b>   button up/down state

       <i>Xterm</i> can see these events as long as it has <i>focus</i>.

       The keyboard also supplies events, but it is less flexible than the
       pointer for selecting/copying text.

       <i>Events</i> are applied to <i>actions</i> using the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> resource.  See
       <b><a href="#h3-Actions">Actions</a></b> for a complete list, and <b><a href="#h3-Default-Key-Bindings">Default Key Bindings</a></b> for the built-in
       set of <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> resources.

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-Selection-Functions" id="h3-Selection-Functions">Selection Functions</a></h3>
<pre>       By default, the selection functions are invoked when the pointer
       buttons are used with no modifiers, and when they are used with the
       "shift" key.  The "shift" key is special, because <i>xterm</i> uses that to
       ensure that selection functions are still available when it is
       programmed to send escape sequences in one of the mouse modes (see
       <i>Xterm Control Sequences</i>, as well as the resource <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:disallowedMouseOps">disallowedMouseOps</a></b>).

       At startup, <i>xterm</i> inspects the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> resource to see which
       pointer buttons may be used in this way, and remembers these buttons
       when deciding whether to send escape sequences or perform selection
       when those buttons are used with the "shift" modifier.  Other pointer
       buttons, e.g., typically those sent for wheel mouse events, are not
       affected.

       The assignment of the functions described below to keys and buttons may
       be changed through the resource database; see <b><a href="#h3-Actions">Actions</a></b> below.

       Pointer button one (usually left)
            is used to save text into the cut buffer:

                ~Meta &lt;Btn1Down&gt;:<b><a href="#Actions:select-start">select-start</a></b>()

            Move the cursor to beginning of the text, and then hold the button
            down while moving the cursor to the end of the region and
            releasing the button.  The selected text is highlighted and is
            saved in the global <i>cut buffer</i> and made the selection when the
            button is released:

                &lt;BtnUp&gt;:<b><a href="#Actions:select-end">select-end</a></b>(<b><a href="#h3-SELECT">SELECT</a></b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b>) \n

            Normally (but see the discussion of <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:on2Clicks">on2Clicks</a></b>, etc):

            <b>o</b>   Double-clicking selects by words.

            <b>o</b>   Triple-clicking selects by lines.

            <b>o</b>   Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc.

            Multiple-click is determined by the time from button up to button
            down, so you can change the selection unit in the middle of a
            selection.  Logical words and lines selected by double- or triple-
            clicking may wrap across more than one screen line if lines were
            wrapped by <i>xterm</i> itself rather than by the application running in
            the window.  If the key/button bindings specify that an X
            selection is to be made, <i>xterm</i> will leave the selected text
            highlighted for as long as it is the selection owner.

       Pointer button two (usually middle)
            "types" (<i>pastes</i>) the text from the given selection, if any,
            otherwise from the cut buffer, inserting it as keyboard input:

                ~Ctrl ~Meta &lt;Btn2Up&gt;:<b>insert-selection(SELECT,</b> <b>CUT_BUFFER0)</b>

       Pointer button three (usually right)
            <i>extends</i> the current selection.

                ~Ctrl ~Meta &lt;Btn3Down&gt;:<b><a href="#Actions:start-extend">start-extend</a></b><b>()</b>

            (Without loss of generality, you can swap "right" and "left"
            everywhere in the rest of this paragraph.)  If pressed while
            closer to the right edge of the selection than the left, it
            extends/contracts the right edge of the selection.  If you
            contract the selection past the left edge of the selection, <i>xterm</i>
            assumes you really meant the left edge, restores the original
            selection, then extends/contracts the left edge of the selection.
            Extension starts in the selection unit mode that the last
            selection or extension was performed in; you can multiple-click to
            cycle through them.

       By cutting and pasting pieces of text without trailing new lines, you
       can take text from several places in different windows and form a
       command to the shell, for example, or take output from a program and
       insert it into your favorite editor.  Since cut buffers are globally
       shared among different applications, you may regard each as a "file"
       whose contents you know.  The terminal emulator and other text programs
       should be treating it as if it were a text file, i.e., the text is
       delimited by new lines.

<h3><a name="h3-Scrolling" id="h3-Scrolling">Scrolling</a></h3>
<pre>       The scroll region displays the position and amount of text currently
       showing in the window (highlighted) relative to the amount of text
       actually saved.  As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size of
       the highlighted area decreases.

       Clicking button one with the pointer in the scroll region moves the
       adjacent line to the top of the display window.

       Clicking button three moves the top line of the display window down to
       the pointer position.

       Clicking button two moves the display to a position in the saved text
       that corresponds to the pointer's position in the scrollbar.

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-Tektronix-Pointer" id="h3-Tektronix-Pointer">Tektronix Pointer</a></h3>
<pre>       Unlike the VT<i>xxx</i> window, the Tektronix window does not allow the
       copying of text.  It does allow Tektronix GIN mode, and in this mode
       the cursor will change from an arrow to a cross.  Pressing any key will
       send that key and the current coordinate of the cross cursor.  Pressing
       button one, two, or three will return the letters "l", "m", and "r",
       respectively.  If the "shift" key is pressed when a pointer button is
       pressed, the corresponding upper case letter is sent.  To distinguish a
       pointer button from a key, the high bit of the character is set (but
       this is bit is normally stripped unless the terminal mode is RAW; see
       <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tty&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=SunOS+4.1.3&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html"><b>tty(4)</b></a> for details).

</pre>
<h2><a name="h2-SELECT_PASTE" id="h2-SELECT_PASTE">SELECT/PASTE</a></h2>
<pre>       X clients provide select and paste support by responding to requests
       conveyed by the X server.  The X server holds data in "atoms" which
       correspond to the different types of selection (<b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b>, <b><a href="#h3-SECONDARY">SECONDARY</a></b>,
       <b><a href="#h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></b>) as well as the similar cut buffer mechanism (<b>CUT_BUFFER0</b> to
       <b>CUT_BUFFER7</b>).  Those are documented in the ICCCM.

       The ICCCM deals with the underlying mechanism for select/paste.  It
       does not mention <i>highlighting</i>.  The <i>selection</i> is not the same as
       <i>highlighting</i>.  <i>Xterm</i> (like many applications) uses highlighting to show
       you the currently selected text.  An X application may <i>own</i> a selection,
       which allows it to be the source of data copied using a given selection
       atom <i>Xterm</i> may continue owning a selection after it stops highlighting
       (see <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:keepSelection">keepSelection</a></b>).

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-PRIMARY" id="h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></h3>
<pre>       When configured to use the primary selection (the default), <i>xterm</i> can
       provide the selection data in ways which help to retain character
       encoding information as it is pasted.

       The <b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b> token is a standard X feature, documented in the ICCCM
       (<i>Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</i>), which states

          The selection named by the atom <b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b> is used for all commands
          that take only a single argument and is the principal means of
          communication between clients that use the selection mechanism.

       A user "selects" text on <i>xterm</i>, which highlights the selected text.  A
       subsequent "paste" to another client forwards a request to the client
       owning the selection.  If <i>xterm</i> owns the primary selection, it makes
       the data available in the form of one or more "selection targets".  If
       it does not own the primary selection, e.g., if it has released it or
       another client has asserted ownership, it relies on cut-buffers to pass
       the data.  But cut-buffers handle only ISO-8859-1 data (officially -
       some clients ignore the rules).

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-CLIPBOARD" id="h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></h3>
<pre>       When configured to use the clipboard (using the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:selectToClipboard">selectToClipboard</a></b>
       resource), the problem with persistence of ownership is bypassed.
       Otherwise, there is no difference regarding the data which can be
       passed via selection.

       The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:selectToClipboard">selectToClipboard</a></b> resource is a compromise, allowing <b><a href="#h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></b> to
       be treated almost like <b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b>, unlike the ICCCM, which describes
       <b><a href="#h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></b> in different terms than <b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b> or <b><a href="#h3-SECONDARY">SECONDARY</a></b>.  Its lengthy
       explanation begins with the essential points:

          The selection named by the atom CLIPBOARD is used to hold data that
          is being transferred between clients, that is, data that usually is
          being cut and then pasted or copied and then pasted.  Whenever a
          client wants to transfer data to the clipboard:

          <b>o</b>   It should assert ownership of the CLIPBOARD.

          <b>o</b>   If it succeeds in acquiring ownership, it should be prepared to
              respond to a request for the contents of the CLIPBOARD in the
              usual way (retaining the data to be able to return it).  The
              request may be generated by the clipboard client described
              below.

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-SELECT" id="h3-SELECT">SELECT</a></h3>
<pre>       However, many applications use <b><a href="#h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></b> in imitation of other
       windowing systems.  The <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:selectToClipboard">selectToClipboard</a></b> resource (and corresponding
       menu entry <b><a href="#VT-Options:Select-to-Clipboard">Select to Clipboard</a></b>) introduce the <b><a href="#h3-SELECT">SELECT</a></b> token (known only
       to <i>xterm</i>) which chooses between the <b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b> and <b><a href="#h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></b> tokens.

       Without using this feature, one can use workarounds such as the <i>xclip</i>
       program to show the contents of the X clipboard within an <i>xterm</i> window.

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-SECONDARY" id="h3-SECONDARY">SECONDARY</a></h3>
<pre>       This is used less often than <b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b> or <b><a href="#h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></b>.  According to the
       ICCCM, it is used

       <b>o</b>   As the second argument to commands taking two arguments (for
           example, "exchange primary and secondary selections")

       <b>o</b>   As a means of obtaining data when there is a primary selection and
           the user does not want to disturb it

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-Selection-Targets" id="h3-Selection-Targets">Selection Targets</a></h3>
<pre>       The different types of data which are passed depend on what the
       receiving client asks for.  These are termed <i>selection targets</i>.

       When asking for the selection data, <i>xterm</i> tries the following types in
       this order:

            UTF8_STRING
                 This is an XFree86 extension, which denotes that the data is
                 encoded in UTF-8.  When <i>xterm</i> is built with wide-character
                 support, it both accepts and provides this type.

            TEXT the text is in the encoding which corresponds to your current
                 locale.

            COMPOUND_TEXT
                 this is a format for multiple character set data, such as
                 multi-lingual text.  It can store UTF-8 data as a special
                 case.

            STRING
                 This is Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) data.

       The middle two (TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT) are added if <i>xterm</i> is
       configured with the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:i18nSelections">i18nSelections</a></b> resource set to "true".

       UTF8_STRING is preferred (therefore first in the list) since <i>xterm</i>
       stores text as Unicode data when running in wide-character mode, and no
       translation is needed.  On the other hand, TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT may
       require translation.  If the translation is incomplete, they will
       insert X's "defaultString" whose value cannot be set, and may simply be
       empty.  <i>Xterm</i>'s <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:defaultString">defaultString</a></b> resource specifies the string to use for
       incomplete translations of the UTF8_STRING.

       You can alter the types which <i>xterm</i> tries using the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitSelectTypes">eightBitSelectTypes</a></b>
       or <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8SelectTypes">utf8SelectTypes</a></b> resources.  For instance, you might have some
       specific locale setting which does not use UTF-8 encoding.  The
       resource value is a comma-separated list of the selection targets,
       which consist of the names shown.  You can use the special name I18N to
       denote the optional inclusion of TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT.  The names are
       matched ignoring case, and can be abbreviated.  The default list can be
       expressed in several ways, e.g.,

              UTF8_STRING,I18N,STRING
              utf8,i18n,string
              u,i,s

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-Mouse-Protocol" id="h3-Mouse-Protocol">Mouse Protocol</a></h3>
<pre>       Applications can send escape sequences to <i>xterm</i> to cause it to send
       escape sequences back to the computer when you press a pointer button,
       or even (depending on which escape sequence) send escape sequences back
       to the computer as you move the pointer.

       These escape sequences and the responses, called the <i>mouse protocol</i>,
       are documented in <i><a href="/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html">XTerm Control Sequences</a></i>.  They do not appear in the
       <i>actions</i> invoked by the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> resource because the resource does
       not change while you run <i>xterm</i>, whereas applications can change the
       mouse prototol (i.e., enable, disable, use different modes).

       However, the mouse protocol is interpreted within the <i>actions</i> that are
       usually associated with the pointer buttons.  <i>Xterm</i> ignores the mouse
       protocol in the <b><a href="#Actions:insert-selection">insert-selection</a></b> action if the shift-key is pressed at
       the same time.  It also modifies a few other actions if the shift-key
       is pressed, e.g., suppressing the response with the pointer position,
       though not eliminating changes to the selected text.

</pre>
<h2><a name="h2-MENUS" id="h2-MENUS">MENUS</a></h2>
<pre>       <i>Xterm</i> has four menus, named <i>mainMenu</i>, <i>vtMenu</i>, <i>fontMenu</i>, and <i>tekMenu</i>.
       Each menu pops up under the correct combinations of key and button
       presses.  Each menu is divided into sections, separated by a horizontal
       line.  Some menu entries correspond to modes that can be altered.  A
       check mark appears next to a mode that is currently active.  Selecting
       one of these modes toggles its state.  Other menu entries are commands;
       selecting one of these performs the indicated function.

       All of the menu entries correspond to X actions.  In the list below,
       the menu label is shown followed by the action's name in parenthesis.

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-Main-Options" id="h3-Main-Options">Main Options</a></h3>
<pre>       The <i>xterm mainMenu</i> pops up when the "control" key and pointer button
       one are pressed in a window.  This menu contains items that apply to
       both the VT<i>xxx</i> and Tektronix windows.  There are several sections:

       Commands for managing X events:

              <b><a title="Main Options:Toolbar" name="Main-Options:Toolbar">Toolbar</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:toolbar">toolbar</a></b>)
                     Clicking on the "Toolbar" menu entry hides the toolbar if
                     it is visible, and shows it if it is not.

              <b><a title="Main Options:Secure Keyboard" name="Main-Options:Secure-Keyboard">Secure Keyboard</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:securekbd">securekbd</a></b>)
                     The <b><a href="#Main-Options:Secure-Keyboard">Secure Keyboard</a></b> mode is helpful when typing in
                     passwords or other sensitive data in an unsecure
                     environment (see <b><a href="#h2-SECURITY">SECURITY</a></b> below, but read the limitations
                     carefully).

              <b><a title="Main Options:Allow SendEvents" name="Main-Options:Allow-SendEvents">Allow SendEvents</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:allowsends">allowsends</a></b>)
                     Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events
                     generated using the X protocol SendEvent request should
                     be interpreted or discarded.  This corresponds to the
                     <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:allowSendEvents">allowSendEvents</a></b> resource.

              <b><a title="Main Options:Redraw Window" name="Main-Options:Redraw-Window">Redraw Window</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:redraw">redraw</a></b>)
                     Forces the X display to repaint; useful in some
                     environments.

       Commands for capturing output:

              <b><a title="Main Options:Log to File" name="Main-Options:Log-to-File">Log to File</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:logging">logging</a></b>)
                     Captures text sent to the screen in a log file, as in the
                     <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-l">-l</a></b> logging option.

              <b><a title="Main Options:Print-All Immediately" name="Main-Options:Print-All-Immediately">Print-All Immediately</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:print-immediate">print-immediate</a></b>)
                     Invokes the <b><a href="#Actions:print-immediate">print-immediate</a></b> action, sending the text of
                     the current window directly to a file, as specified by
                     the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printFileImmediate">printFileImmediate</a></b>, <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printModeImmediate">printModeImmediate</a></b> and
                     <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printOptsImmediate">printOptsImmediate</a></b> resources.

              <b><a title="Main Options:Print-All on Error" name="Main-Options:Print-All-on-Error">Print-All on Error</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:print-on-error">print-on-error</a></b>)
                     Invokes the <b><a href="#Actions:print-on-error">print-on-error</a></b> action, which toggles a flag
                     telling <i>xterm</i> that if it exits with an X error, to send
                     the text of the current window directly to a file, as
                     specified by the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printFileOnXError">printFileOnXError</a></b>, <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printModeOnXError">printModeOnXError</a></b> and
                     <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printOptsOnXError">printOptsOnXError</a></b> resources.

              <b><a title="Main Options:Print Window" name="Main-Options:Print-Window">Print Window</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:print">print</a></b>)
                     Sends the text of the current window to the program given
                     in the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printerCommand">printerCommand</a></b> resource.

              <b><a title="Main Options:Redirect to Printer" name="Main-Options:Redirect-to-Printer">Redirect to Printer</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:print-redir">print-redir</a></b>)
                     This sets the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printerControlMode">printerControlMode</a></b> to 0 or 2.  You can use
                     this to turn the printer on as if an application had sent
                     the appropriate control sequence.  It is also useful for
                     switching the printer off if an application turns it on
                     without resetting the print control mode.

              <b><a title="Main Options:XHTML Screen Dump" name="Main-Options:XHTML-Screen-Dump">XHTML Screen Dump</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:dump-html">dump-html</a></b>)
                     Available only when compiled with screen dump support.
                     Invokes the <b><a href="#Actions:dump-html">dump-html</a></b> action.  This creates an XHTML file
                     matching the contents of the current screen, including
                     the border, internal border, colors and most attributes:
                     bold, italic, underline, faint, strikeout, reverse; blink
                     is rendered as white-on-red; double underline is rendered
                     the same as underline since there is no portable
                     equivalent in CSS 2.2.

                     The font is whatever your browser uses for preformatted
                     (&lt;pre&gt;) elements.  The XHTML file references a cascading
                     style sheet (CSS) named "<b>xterm.css</b>" that you can create
                     to select a font or override properties.

                     The following CSS selectors are used with the expected
                     default behavior in the XHTML file:

                     <i>.ul</i> for underline,
                     <i>.bd</i> for bold,
                     <i>.it</i> for italic,
                     <i>.st</i> for strikeout,
                     <i>.lu</i> for strikeout combined with underline.

                     In addition you may use

                     <i>.ev</i> to affect even numbered lines and
                     <i>.od</i> to affect odd numbered lines.

                     Attributes faint, reverse and blink are implemented as
                     <i>style</i> attributes setting color properties.  All colors
                     are specified as RGB percentages in order to support
                     displays with 10 bits per RGB.

                     However some window managers treat the clipboard
                     specially.  For instance, XQuartz's synchronization
                     between the OSX <i>pasteboard</i> and the X11 <i>clipboard</i> causes
                     applications to lose the selection ownership for that

                         and the escape sequence states will be XOR'd: if both
                         are enabled, the cursor will not blink, if only one
                         is enabled, the cursor will blink.

                     <b>o</b>   If the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlinkXOR">cursorBlinkXOR</a></b> is not set; if either the menu
                         entry or the escape sequence states are set, the
                         cursor will blink.

                     In either case, the checkbox for the menu shows the state
                     of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlink">cursorBlink</a></b> resource, which may not correspond to

                     When enabled, each graphic image uses a separate set of

                     The default is likely a more useful mode on modern

                     This corresponds to the VT220 DECSTR control sequence.  A
                     soft reset leaves the contents of the window intact, but
                     resets modes which affect subsequent updates:

                     Soft reset differs from full reset in a minor detail:

                     <b>o</b>   Set the saved cursor position to the upper-left
                         corner of the window.

                     <b>o</b>   Exit from the status-line without erasing it.

                     Both soft/full resets do the following:

                     <b>o</b>   Make the cursor visible, with shape reset according
                         to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorUnderLine">cursorUnderLine</a></b> and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBar">cursorBar</a></b> resources.

                         to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:cursorBlink">cursorBlink</a></b> resource, and set the <i>Enable</i>
                         <i>Blinking Cursor</i> menu checkmark to match.

                     <b>o</b>   Reset video attributes, e.g., bold, italic,

                         using VMS or TOPS-20).

                     <b>o</b>   Set autowrap and reverse wrapping according to the

                     <b>o</b>   Clear the window.

                     <b>o</b>   Reset tab stops to every eight columns.

                     <b>o</b>   Reset the readline and bracketed paste modes.

                     <b>o</b>   Discard all SIXEL and ReGIS graphics data from
                         memory.

                     <b>o</b>   Reset <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:sixelScrolling">sixelScrolling</a></b> and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:privateColorRegisters">privateColorRegisters</a></b> from
                         initial resource values.

                     <b>o</b>   Set DECSDM if the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:sixelScrolling">sixelScrolling</a></b> resource is true.
                         Otherwise, reset DECSDM.

                     A full reset does this, unlike a soft reset:

                     <b>o</b>   Move the cursor to the upper-left corner of the
                         window, and then save that position.

                     <b>o</b>   Hide the status-line, setting its display-type to
                         "none".

              <b><a title="VT Options:Reset and Clear Saved Lines" name="VT-Options:Reset-and-Clear-Saved-Lines">Reset and Clear Saved Lines</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:clearsavedlines">clearsavedlines</a></b>)
                     Perform a full reset, and also clear the saved lines.

                     This corresponds to the VT102 RIS control sequence, with
                     a few obvious differences.  For example, your session is
                     not disconnected as a real VT102 would do.

       are several sections.

       The first section allows you to select the font from a set of

                     This allows you to set the font last specified by the Set

                     a font when displaying characters.  Use the maximum width
                     (unchecked) to help display proportional fonts.  Compare
                     to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:forcePackedFont">forcePackedFont</a></b> resource.

                     When set, <i>xterm</i> may ask the font server to produce scaled
                     versions of the normal font, for VT102 double-size
                     characters.

       The third section allows you to modify the way it is specified:

              <b><a title="VT Fonts:TrueType Fonts" name="VT-Fonts:TrueType-Fonts">TrueType Fonts</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:render-font">render-font</a></b>)
                     If the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:renderFont">renderFont</a></b> and corresponding resources were set,
                     this is a further control whether <i>xterm</i> will actually use
                     the Xft library calls to obtain a font.

              <b><a title="VT Fonts:UTF-8 Encoding" name="VT-Fonts:UTF-8-Encoding">UTF-8 Encoding</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:utf8-mode">utf8-mode</a></b>)
                     This controls whether <i>xterm</i> uses UTF-8 encoding of
                     input/output.  It is useful for temporarily switching
                     <i>xterm</i> to display text from an application which does not
                     follow the locale settings.  It corresponds to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b>
                     resource.

              <b><a title="VT Fonts:UTF-8 Fonts" name="VT-Fonts:UTF-8-Fonts">UTF-8 Fonts</a></b> (resource <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:utf8-fonts">utf8-fonts</a></b>)
                     This controls whether <i>xterm</i> uses UTF-8 fonts for display.
                     It is useful for temporarily switching <i>xterm</i> to display
                     text from an application which does not follow the locale
                     settings.  It combines the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b> and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8Fonts">utf8Fonts</a></b> resources,
                     subject to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:locale">locale</a></b> resource.

                     This controls whether <i>xterm</i> accepts UTF-8 encoding for
                     title control sequences.  It corresponds to the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8Fonts">utf8Fonts</a></b>
                     resource.

                     Initially the checkmark is set according to both the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8">utf8</a></b>
                     and <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8Fonts">utf8Fonts</a></b> resource values.  If the latter is set to
                     "always", the checkmark is disabled.  Likewise, if there
                     are no fonts given in the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:utf8Fonts">utf8Fonts</a></b> subresources, then
                     the checkmark also is disabled.

                     The standard <b>XTerm</b> app-defaults file defines both sets of
                     fonts, while the <b>UXTerm</b> app-defaults file defines only
                     one set.  Assuming the standard app-defaults files, this
                     command will launch <i>xterm</i> able to switch between UTF-8
                     and ISO-8859-1 encoded fonts:

                         uxterm -class XTerm

       The fourth section allows you to enable or disable special operations
       which can be controlled by writing escape sequences to the terminal.

<h2><a name="h2-SECURITY" id="h2-SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h2>
<pre>       X environments differ in their security consciousness.

       <b>o</b>   Most servers, run under <i>xdm</i>, are capable of using a "magic cookie"
           authorization scheme that can provide a reasonable level of
           security for many people.  If your server is only using a host-
           based mechanism to control access to the server (see <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/xhost.1.xhtml"><b>xhost(1)</b></a>),
           then if you enable access for a host and other users are also
           permitted to run clients on that same host, it is possible that
           someone can run an application which uses the basic services of the
           X protocol to snoop on your activities, potentially capturing a
           transcript of everything you type at the keyboard.

       <b>o</b>   Any process which has access to your X display can manipulate it in
           ways that you might not anticipate, even redirecting your keyboard
           to itself and sending events to your application's windows.  This
           is true even with the "magic cookie" authorization scheme.  While
           the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:allowSendEvents">allowSendEvents</a></b> provides some protection against rogue
           applications tampering with your programs, guarding against a
           snooper is harder.

       <b>o</b>   The X input extension for instance allows an application to bypass
           all of the other (limited) authorization and security features,
           including the GrabKeyboard protocol.

       <b>o</b>   The possibility of an application spying on your keystrokes is of
           particular concern when you want to type in a password or other
           sensitive data.  The best solution to this problem is to use a
           better authorization mechanism than is provided by X.

       Subject to all of these caveats, a simple mechanism exists for
       protecting keyboard input in <i>xterm</i>.

       The <i>xterm</i> menu (see <b><a href="#h2-MENUS">MENUS</a></b> above) contains a <b><a href="#Main-Options:Secure-Keyboard">Secure Keyboard</a></b> entry
       which, when enabled, attempts to ensure that all keyboard input is
       directed <i>only</i> to <i>xterm</i> (using the GrabKeyboard protocol request).  When
       an application prompts you for a password (or other sensitive data),
       you can enable <b><a href="#Main-Options:Secure-Keyboard">Secure Keyboard</a></b> using the menu, type in the data, and
       then disable <b><a href="#Main-Options:Secure-Keyboard">Secure Keyboard</a></b> using the menu again.

       <b>o</b>   This ensures that you know which window is accepting your
           keystrokes.

       <b>o</b>   It cannot ensure that there are no processes which have access to
           your X display that might be observing the keystrokes as well.

       Only one X client at a time can grab the keyboard, so when you attempt
       to enable <b><a href="#Main-Options:Secure-Keyboard">Secure Keyboard</a></b> it may fail.  In this case, the bell will
       sound.  If the <b><a href="#Main-Options:Secure-Keyboard">Secure Keyboard</a></b> succeeds, the foreground and background
       colors will be exchanged (as if you selected the <b><a href="#VT-Options:Enable-Reverse-Video">Enable Reverse Video</a></b>
       entry in the <b>Modes</b> menu); they will be exchanged again when you exit
       secure mode.  If the colors do <i>not</i> switch, then you should be <i>very</i>
       suspicious that you are being spoofed.  If the application you are
       running displays a prompt before asking for the password, it is safest
       to enter secure mode <i>before</i> the prompt gets displayed, and to make sure
       that the prompt gets displayed correctly (in the new colors), to
       minimize the probability of spoofing.  You can also bring up the menu
       again and make sure that a check mark appears next to the entry.

       <b><a href="#Main-Options:Secure-Keyboard">Secure Keyboard</a></b> mode will be disabled automatically if your <i>xterm</i>
       window becomes iconified (or otherwise unmapped), or if you start up a
       reparenting window manager (that places a title bar or other decoration
       around the window) while in <b><a href="#Main-Options:Secure-Keyboard">Secure Keyboard</a></b> mode.  (This is a feature
       of the X protocol not easily overcome.)  When this happens, the
       foreground and background colors will be switched back and the bell
       will sound in warning.

<h2><a name="h2-CHARACTER-CLASSES" id="h2-CHARACTER-CLASSES">CHARACTER CLASSES</a></h2>
<pre>       Clicking the left pointer button twice in rapid succession (double-
       clicking) causes all characters of the same class (e.g., letters, white
       space, punctuation) to be selected as a "word".  Since different people
       have different preferences for what should be selected (for example,
       should filenames be selected as a whole or only the separate subnames),
       the default mapping can be overridden through the use of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:charClass">charClass</a></b>
       (class <i>CharClass</i>) resource.

       This resource is a series of comma-separated <i>range</i>:<i>value</i> pairs.

       <b>o</b>   The <i>range</i> is either a single number or <i>low</i>-<i>high</i> in the range of 0
           to 65535, corresponding to the code for the character or characters
           to be set.

       <b>o</b>   The <i>value</i> is arbitrary.  For example, the default table uses the
           character number of the first character occurring in the set.  When
           not in UTF-8 mode, only the first 256 entries of this table will be
           used.

       The default table starts as follows -

              For example, the string "33:48,37:48,45-47:48,38:48" indicates
              that the exclamation mark, percent sign, dash, period, slash,
              and ampersand characters should be treated the same way as
              characters and numbers.  This is useful for cutting and pasting
              electronic mailing addresses and filenames.

       or tek4014 widgets.  Changing the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> resource for events

               This action toggles the state of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:altSendsEscape">altSendsEscape</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="Actions:bell" name="Actions:bell">bell</a></b><b>([</b><i>percent</i><b>])</b>
               This action rings the keyboard bell at the specified percentage

       <b><a title="Actions:clear-saved-lines" name="Actions:clear-saved-lines">clear-saved-lines</a></b><b>()</b>
               This action does <b><a href="#Actions:hard-reset">hard-reset</a></b><b>()</b> and also clears the history of
               lines saved off the top of the screen.  It is also invoked from
               the <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:clearsavedlines">clearsavedlines</a></b> entry in <i>vtMenu</i>.  The effect is identical
               to a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence.

       <b><a title="Actions:copy-selection" name="Actions:copy-selection">copy-selection</a></b><b>(</b><i>destname</i> <b>[,</b> <b>...])</b>
               This action puts the currently selected text into all of the
               selections or cutbuffers specified by <i>destname</i>.  Unlike
               <b><a href="#Actions:select-end">select-end</a></b>, it does not send a mouse position or otherwise
               modify the internal selection state.

       <b><a title="Actions:create-menu" name="Actions:create-menu">create-menu</a></b><b>(</b><i>m/v/f/t</i><b>)</b>
               This action creates one of the menus used by <i>xterm</i>, if it has
               not been previously created.  The parameter values are the menu
               names: <i>mainMenu</i>, <i>vtMenu</i>, <i>fontMenu</i>, <i>tekMenu</i>, respectively.

       <b><a title="Actions:dabbrev-expand" name="Actions:dabbrev-expand">dabbrev-expand</a></b><b>()</b>
               Expands the word before cursor by searching in the preceding
               text on the screen and in the scrollback buffer for words
               starting with that abbreviation.  Repeating <b><a href="#Actions:dabbrev-expand">dabbrev-expand</a></b><b>()</b>
               several times in sequence searches for an alternative expansion
               by looking farther back.  Lack of more matches is signaled by a
               bell.  Attempts to expand an empty word (i.e., when cursor is
               preceded by a space) yield successively all previous words.
               Consecutive identical expansions are ignored.  The word here is
               defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters.  This
               feature partially emulates the behavior of "dynamic
               abbreviation" expansion in Emacs (bound there to M-/).  Here is
               a resource setting for <i>xterm</i> which will do the same thing:

                   *VT100*translations:    #override \n\
                           Meta &lt;KeyPress&gt; /:<b><a href="#Actions:dabbrev-expand">dabbrev-expand</a></b>()

       <b><a title="Actions:deiconify" name="Actions:deiconify">deiconify</a></b><b>()</b>
               Changes the window state back to normal, if it was iconified.

       <b><a title="Actions:delete-is-del" name="Actions:delete-is-del">delete-is-del</a></b><b>()</b>
               This action toggles the state of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:deleteIsDEL">deleteIsDEL</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="Actions:dired-button" name="Actions:dired-button">dired-button</a></b><b>()</b>
               Handles a button event (other than press and release) by
               echoing the event's position (i.e., character line and column)
               in the following format:

                   ^X ESC G &lt;line+" "&gt; &lt;col+" "&gt;

       <b><a title="Actions:dump-html" name="Actions:dump-html">dump-html</a></b><b>()</b>
               Invokes the <b><a href="#Main-Options:XHTML-Screen-Dump">XHTML Screen Dump</a></b> feature.

       <b><a title="Actions:dump-svg" name="Actions:dump-svg">dump-svg</a></b><b>()</b>
               Invokes the <b><a href="#Main-Options:SVG-Screen-Dump">SVG Screen Dump</a></b> feature.

       <b><a title="Actions:exec-formatted" name="Actions:exec-formatted">exec-formatted</a></b><b>(</b><i>format</i><b>,</b> <i>sourcename</i> <b>[,</b> <b>...])</b>
               Execute an external command, using the current selection for
               part of the command's parameters.  The first parameter, <i>format</i>
               gives the basic command.  Succeeding parameters specify the
               selection source as in <b><a href="#Actions:insert-selection">insert-selection</a></b>.

               The <i>format</i> parameter allows these substitutions:

               %%   inserts a "%".

               %P   the screen-position at the beginning of the highlighted
                    region, as a semicolon-separated pair of integers using
                    the values that the CUP control sequence would use.

               %p   the screen-position after the beginning of the highlighted
                    region, using the same convention as "%P".

               %S   the length of the string that "%s" would insert.

               %s   the content of the selection, unmodified.

               %T   the length of the string that "%t" would insert.

               %t   the selection, trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace.
                    Embedded spaces (and newlines) are copied as is.

               %R   the length of the string that "%r" would insert.

               %r   the selection, trimmed of trailing whitespace.

               %V   the video attributes at the beginning of the highlighted
                    region, as a semicolon-separated list of integers using
                    the values that the SGR control sequence would use.

               %v   the video attributes after the end of the highlighted
                    region, using the same convention as "%V".

               After constructing the command-string, <i>xterm</i> forks a subprocess
               and executes the command, which completes independently of
               <i>xterm</i>.

               For example, this translation would invoke a new <i>xterm</i> process
               to view a file whose name is selected while holding the shift
               key down.  The new process is started when the mouse button is
               released:

                   *VT100*translations: #override Shift \
                       &lt;Btn1Up&gt;:<b><a href="#Actions:exec-formatted">exec-formatted</a></b>("xterm -e view '%t'", <b><a href="#h3-SELECT">SELECT</a></b>)

       <b><a title="Actions:exec-selectable" name="Actions:exec-selectable">exec-selectable</a></b><b>(</b><i>format</i><b>,</b> <i>onClicks</i><b>)</b>
               Execute an external command, using data copied from the screen
               for part of the command's parameters.  The first parameter,
               <i>format</i> gives the basic command as in <b><a href="#Actions:exec-formatted">exec-formatted</a></b>.  The
               second parameter specifies the method for copying the data as
               in the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:on2Clicks">on2Clicks</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="Actions:fullscreen" name="Actions:fullscreen">fullscreen</a></b><b>(</b><i>on/off/toggle</i><b>)</b>
               This action sets, unsets or toggles the <b><a href="#Actions:fullscreen">fullscreen</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="Actions:hard-reset" name="Actions:hard-reset">hard-reset</a></b><b>()</b>
               This action resets the scrolling region, tabs, window size, and
               cursor keys and clears the screen.  It is also invoked from the
               <b><a href="#Menu-Resources:hardreset">hardreset</a></b> entry in <i>vtMenu</i>.

       <b><a title="Actions:iconify" name="Actions:iconify">iconify</a></b><b>()</b>
               Iconifies the window.

       <b><a title="Actions:ignore" name="Actions:ignore">ignore</a></b><b>()</b>
               This action ignores the event but checks for special pointer
               position escape sequences.

       <b><a title="Actions:insert" name="Actions:insert">insert</a></b><b>()</b>
               This action inserts the character or string associated with the
               key that was pressed.

       <b><a title="Actions:insert-eight-bit" name="Actions:insert-eight-bit">insert-eight-bit</a></b><b>()</b>
               This action inserts an eight-bit (Meta) version of the
               character or string associated with the key that was pressed.
               Only single-byte values are treated specially.  The exact
               action depends on the value of the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:altSendsEscape">altSendsEscape</a></b> and the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:metaSendsEscape">metaSendsEscape</a></b> and the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitInput">eightBitInput</a></b> resources.  The
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:metaSendsEscape">metaSendsEscape</a></b> resource is tested first.  See the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:eightBitInput">eightBitInput</a></b> resource for a full discussion.

               The term "eight-bit" is misleading: <i>xterm</i> checks if the key is
               in the range 128 to 255 (the eighth bit is set).  If the value
               is in that range, depending on the resource values, <i>xterm</i> may
               then do one of the following:

               <b>o</b>   add 128 to the value, setting its eighth bit,

               <b>o</b>   send an ESC byte before the key, or

               <b>o</b>   send the key unaltered.

       <b><a title="Actions:insert-formatted" name="Actions:insert-formatted">insert-formatted</a></b><b>(</b><i>format</i><b>,</b> <i>sourcename</i> <b>[,</b> <b>...])</b>
               Insert the current selection or data related to it, formatted.
               The first parameter, <i>format</i> gives the template for the data as
               in <b><a href="#Actions:exec-formatted">exec-formatted</a></b>.  Succeeding parameters specify the selection
               source as in <b><a href="#Actions:insert-selection">insert-selection</a></b>.

       <b><a title="Actions:insert-selectable" name="Actions:insert-selectable">insert-selectable</a></b><b>(</b><i>format</i><b>,</b> <i>onClicks</i><b>)</b>
               Insert data copied from the screen, formatted.  The first
               parameter, <i>format</i> gives the template for the data as in
               <b><a href="#Actions:exec-formatted">exec-formatted</a></b>.  The second parameter specifies the method for
               copying the data as in the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:on2Clicks">on2Clicks</a></b> resource.

       <b><a title="Actions:insert-selection" name="Actions:insert-selection">insert-selection</a></b><b>(</b><i>sourcename</i> <b>[,</b> <b>...])</b>
               This action inserts the string found in the selection or
               cutbuffer indicated by <i>sourcename</i>.  Sources are checked in the
               order given (case is significant) until one is found.
               Commonly-used selections include: <b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b>, <b><a href="#h3-SECONDARY">SECONDARY</a></b>, and
               <b><a href="#h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></b>.  Cut buffers are typically named <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b> through
               <b>CUT_BUFFER7</b>.

       <b><a title="Actions:insert-seven-bit" name="Actions:insert-seven-bit">insert-seven-bit</a></b><b>()</b>
               This action is a synonym for <b><a href="#Actions:insert">insert</a></b><b>()</b>.  The term "seven-bit" is
               misleading: it only implies that <i>xterm</i> does not try to add 128
               to the key's value as in <b><a href="#Actions:insert-eight-bit">insert-eight-bit</a></b><b>()</b>.

       <b><a title="Actions:interpret" name="Actions:interpret">interpret</a></b><b>(</b><i>control-sequence</i><b>)</b>
               Interpret the given control sequence locally, i.e., without
               passing it to the host.  This works by inserting the control
               sequence at the front of the input buffer.  Use "\" to escape
               octal digits in the string.  Xt does not allow you to put a
               null character (i.e., "\000") in the string.

       <b><a title="Actions:keymap" name="Actions:keymap">keymap</a></b><b>(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b>
               This action dynamically defines a new translation table whose
               resource name is <i>name</i> with the suffix "<i>Keymap</i>" (i.e.,
               <a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:..name..Keymap"><i>name</i><b>Keymap</b></a>, where case is significant).  The name <i>None</i> restores
               the original translation table.

               If no name is given, the original set of fontnames is restored.

               Unlike <b><a href="#Actions:set-vt-font">set-vt-font</a></b><b>()</b>, this does not affect the escape- and
               select-fonts, since those are not based on resource values.  It
               does affect the fonts loosely organized under the "Default"
               menu entry, including <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:font">font</a></b>, <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:boldFont">boldFont</a></b>, <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:wideFont">wideFont</a></b> and

               NewLine
                    a newline will be sent at the end of the last line
                    printed, and each line will be limited (by adding a
                    newline) to the screen width (i.e., <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printerNewLine">printerNewLine</a></b> is
                    "true").

               noAttrs
                    the page is printed without attributes (i.e.,
                    <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printAttributes">printAttributes</a></b> is "0").

               monoAttrs
                    the page is printed with monochrome (vt220) attributes
                    (i.e., <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printAttributes">printAttributes</a></b> is "1").

               colorAttrs
                    the page is printed with ANSI color attributes (i.e.,
                    <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printAttributes">printAttributes</a></b> is "2").

       <b><a title="Actions:print-everything" name="Actions:print-everything">print-everything</a></b><b>(</b><i>printer-flags</i><b>)</b>
               This action sends the entire text history, in addition to the
               text currently visible, to the program given in the
               <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printerCommand">printerCommand</a></b> resource.  It allows the same optional
               parameters as the <b><a href="#Actions:print">print</a></b> action.  With a suitable printer
               command, the action can be used to load the text history in an
               editor.

       <b><a title="Actions:print-immediate" name="Actions:print-immediate">print-immediate</a></b><b>()</b>
               Sends the text of the current window directly to a file, as

       <b><a title="Actions:print-redir" name="Actions:print-redir">print-redir</a></b><b>()</b>
               This action toggles the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:printerControlMode">printerControlMode</a></b> between 0 and 2.
               The corresponding popup menu entry is useful for switching the
               printer off if you happen to change your mind after deciding to
               print random binary files on the terminal.

       <b><a title="Actions:quit" name="Actions:quit">quit</a></b><b>()</b>

               This action scrolls the text window backward so that text that
               had previously scrolled off the top of the screen is now
               visible.

               The <i>count</i> argument indicates the number of <i>units</i> (which may be
               <i>page</i>, <i>halfpage</i>, <i>pixel</i>, or <i>line</i>) by which to scroll.  If no
               <i>count</i> parameter is given, <i>xterm</i> uses the number of lines given
               by the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:scrollLines">scrollLines</a></b> resource.

               An adjustment can be specified for the <i>page</i> or <i>halfpage</i> units
               by appending a "+" or "-" sign followed by a number, e.g.,
               <i>page-2</i> to specify 2 lines less than a page.

               If the second parameter is omitted "lines" is used.

               If the third parameter <i>mouse</i> is given, the action is ignored
               when mouse reporting is enabled.

       <b><a title="Actions:scroll-forw" name="Actions:scroll-forw">scroll-forw</a></b><b>(</b><i>count</i> <b>[,</b><i>units</i> <b>[,</b><i>mouse</i><b>]</b> <b>])</b>
               This action is similar to <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-back">scroll-back</a></b> except that it scrolls in
               the other direction.

       <b><a title="Actions:scroll-lock" name="Actions:scroll-lock">scroll-lock</a></b><b>(</b><i>on/off/toggle</i><b>)</b>
               This action sets, unsets or toggles internal state which tells

               Scroll to the given line relative to the beginning of the
               saved-lines.  For instance, "<b><a href="#Actions:scroll-to">scroll-to</a>(0)</b>" would scroll to the
               beginning.  Two special nonnumeric parameters are recognized:

               <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-to">scroll-to</a>(begin)</b>
                       Scroll to the beginning of the saved lines.

               <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-to">scroll-to</a>(end)</b>
                       Scroll to the end of the saved lines, i.e., to the
                       currently active page.

       <b><a title="Actions:secure" name="Actions:secure">secure</a></b><b>()</b>
               This action toggles the <i>Secure Keyboard</i> mode (see <b><a href="#h2-SECURITY">SECURITY</a></b>),

               VT<i>xxx</i> window.  The first argument is a single character that
               specifies the font to be used:

               <i>d</i> or <i>D</i> indicate the default font (the font initially used when
                      <i>xterm</i> was started),

               <i>1</i> through <i>7</i> indicate the fonts specified by the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:font1">font1</a></b> through
                      <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:font7">font7</a></b> resources,

               <i>e</i> or <i>E</i> indicate the normal and bold fonts that have been set

                      <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xfontsel"><b>xfontsel(1)</b></a>) indicated by the second action argument.

               If <i>xterm</i> is configured to support wide characters, an
               additional two optional parameters are recognized for the <i>e</i>
               argument: wide font and wide bold font.

               Spawn a new <i>xterm</i> process.  This is available on systems which
               have a modern version of the process filesystem, e.g., "/proc",
               which <i>xterm</i> can read.

               Use the "cwd" process entry, e.g., /proc/12345/cwd to obtain
               the working directory of the process which is running in the
               current <i>xterm</i>.

               On systems which have the "exe" process entry, e.g.,
               /proc/12345/exe, use this to obtain the actual executable.
               Otherwise, use the <b>$PATH</b> variable to find <i>xterm</i>.

               If parameters are given in the action, pass them to the new
               <i>xterm</i> process.

               argument begins with the characters "0x", it is interpreted as
               a hex character constant.

               echoing a control sequence computed from the event's line
               number in the screen relative to the current line:

                   ESC ^P

               or

                   ESC ^N

               according to whether the event is before, or after the current
               line, respectively.  The ^N (or ^P) is repeated once for each
               line that the event differs from the current line.  The control
               sequence is omitted altogether if the button event is on the
               current line.

       <b><a title="Actions:visual-bell" name="Actions:visual-bell">visual-bell</a></b><b>()</b>

<h3><a name="h3-Custom-Key-Bindings" id="h3-Custom-Key-Bindings">Custom Key Bindings</a></h3>
<pre>       You can modify the <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> resource by overriding parts of it, or
       merging your resources with it.

       Here is an example which uses shifted select/paste to copy to the
       clipboard, and unshifted select/paste for the primary selection.  In
       each case, a (different) cut buffer is also a target or source of the
       select/paste operation.  It is important to remember however, that cut
       buffers store data in ISO-8859-1 encoding, while selections can store
       data in a variety of formats and encodings.  While <i>xterm</i> owns the
       selection, it highlights it.  When it loses the selection, it removes
       the corresponding highlight.  But you can still paste from the
       corresponding cut buffer.

           *VT100*translations:    #override \n\
              ~Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;: <b><a href="#Actions:insert-selection">insert-selection</a></b>(<b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b>) \n\
               Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;: <b><a href="#Actions:insert-selection">insert-selection</a></b>(<b><a href="#h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER1</b>) \n\
              ~Shift     &lt;BtnUp&gt; : <b><a href="#Actions:select-end">select-end</a></b>(<b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b>) \n\
               Shift     &lt;BtnUp&gt; : <b><a href="#Actions:select-end">select-end</a></b>(<b><a href="#h3-CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a></b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER1</b>)

       In the example, the class name <b>VT100</b> is used rather than the widget
       name.  These are different; a class name could apply to more than one
       widget.  A leading "*" is used because the widget hierarchy above the
       <i>vt100</i> widget depends on whether the toolbar support is compiled into
       <i>xterm</i>.

       Most of the predefined translations are related to the mouse, with a
       few that use some of the special keys on the keyboard.  Applications
       use special keys (function-keys, cursor-keys, keypad-keys) with
       modifiers (shift, control, alt).  If <i>xterm</i> defines a translation for a
       given combination of special key and modifier, that makes it
       unavailable for use by applications within the terminal.  For instance,
       one might extend the use of <i>Page Up</i> and <i>Page Down</i> keys seen here:

               Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; Prior : <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-back">scroll-back</a></b>(1,halfpage) \n\
               Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; Next  : <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-forw">scroll-forw</a></b>(1,halfpage) \n\

       to the <i>Home</i> and <i>End</i> keys:

               Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; Home : <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-to">scroll-to</a></b>(begin) \n\
               Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; End  : <b><a href="#Actions:scroll-to">scroll-to</a></b>(end)

       but then shift-<i>Home</i> and shift-<i>End</i> would then be unavailable to
       applications.

       Not everyone finds the three-button mouse bindings easy to use.  In a
       wheel mouse, the middle button might be the wheel.  As an alternative,
       you could add a binding using shifted keys:

           *VT100*translations:      #override \n\
               Shift &lt;Key&gt;Home:    <b><a href="#Actions:copy-selection">copy-selection</a></b>(<b><a href="#h3-SELECT">SELECT</a></b>) \n\
               Shift &lt;Key&gt;Insert:  <b><a href="#Actions:copy-selection">copy-selection</a></b>(<b><a href="#h3-SELECT">SELECT</a></b>) \n\
               Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;C:  <b><a href="#Actions:copy-selection">copy-selection</a></b>(<b><a href="#h3-SELECT">SELECT</a></b>) \n\
               Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;V:  <b><a href="#Actions:insert-selection">insert-selection</a></b>(<b><a href="#h3-SELECT">SELECT</a></b>)

       You would still use the left- and right-mouse buttons (typically 1 and
       3) for beginning and extending selections.

       Besides mouse problems, there are also keyboards with inconvenient
       layouts.  Some lack a numeric keypad, making it hard to use the shifted
       keypad plus and minus bindings for switching between font sizes.  You
       can work around that by assigning the actions to more readily accessed
       keys:

           *VT100*translations:      #override \n\
               Ctrl &lt;Key&gt; +:       <b><a href="#Actions:larger-vt-font">larger-vt-font</a></b>() \n\
               Ctrl &lt;Key&gt; -:       <b><a href="#Actions:smaller-vt-font">smaller-vt-font</a></b>()

       The keymap feature allows you to switch between sets of translations.
       The sample below shows how the <b><a href="#Actions:keymap">keymap</a></b><b>()</b> action may be used to add
       special keys for entering commonly-typed words:

           *VT100.Translations: #override &lt;Key&gt;F13: keymap(dbx)
           *VT100.dbxKeymap.translations: \
                   &lt;Key&gt;F14:       <b><a href="#Actions:keymap">keymap</a></b>(None) \n\
                   &lt;Key&gt;F17:       <b><a href="#Actions:string">string</a></b>("next") \n\
                                   <b><a href="#Actions:string">string</a>(0x0d)</b> \n\
                   &lt;Key&gt;F18:       <b><a href="#Actions:string">string</a></b>("step") \n\
                                   <b><a href="#Actions:string">string</a>(0x0d)</b> \n\
                   &lt;Key&gt;F19:       <b><a href="#Actions:string">string</a></b>("continue") \n\
                                   <b><a href="#Actions:string">string</a>(0x0d)</b> \n\
                   &lt;Key&gt;F20:       <b><a href="#Actions:string">string</a></b>("print ") \n\
                                   <b><a href="#Actions:insert-selection">insert-selection</a></b>(<b><a href="#h3-PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a></b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b>)

<h3><a name="h3-Default-Scrollbar-Bindings" id="h3-Default-Scrollbar-Bindings">Default Scrollbar Bindings</a></h3>
<pre>       Key bindings are normally associated with the <i>vt100</i> or <i>tek4014</i> widgets
       which act as terminal emulators.  <i>Xterm</i>'s scrollbar (and toolbar if it
       is configured) are separate widgets.  Because all of these use the <i>X</i>
       <i>Toolkit</i>, they have corresponding <b><a href="#VT100-Widget-Resources:translations">translations</a></b> resources.  Those
       resources are distinct, and match different patterns, e.g., the
       differences in widget-name and number of levels of widgets which they
       may contain.

       The <i>scrollbar</i> widget is a child of the <i>vt100</i> widget.  It is positioned
       on top of the <i>vt100</i> widget.  Toggling the scrollbar on and off causes
       the <i>vt100</i> widget to resize.

       The default bindings for the scrollbar widget use only mouse-button
       events:

              &lt;Btn5Down&gt;: StartScroll(Forward) \n\
              &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: StartScroll(Forward) \n\
              &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
              &lt;Btn3Down&gt;: StartScroll(Backward) \n\
              &lt;Btn4Down&gt;: StartScroll(Backward) \n\
              &lt;Btn2Motion&gt;: MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
              &lt;BtnUp&gt;:    NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()

       Events which the <i>scrollbar</i> widget does not recognize at all are lost.

       However, at startup, <i>xterm</i> augments these translations with the default
       translations used for the <i>vt100</i> widget, together with the resource
       "actions" which those translations use.  Because the <i>scrollbar</i> (or
       <i>menubar</i>) widgets do not recognize these actions (but because it has a
       corresponding translation), they are passed on to the <i>vt100</i> widget.

       This augmenting of the scrollbar's translations has a few limitations:

       <b>o</b>   <i>Xterm</i> knows what the default translations are, but there is no
           suitable library interface for determining what customizations a
           user may have added to the <i>vt100</i> widget.  All that <i>xterm</i> can do is
           augment the <i>scrollbar</i> widget to give it the same starting point for
           further customization by the user.

       <b>o</b>   Events in the gap between the widgets may be lost.

       <b>o</b>   Compose sequences begun in one widget cannot be completed in the
           other, because the input methods for each widget do not share
           context information.

       Most customizations of the scrollbar translations do not concern key
       bindings.  Rather, users are generally more interested in changing the
       bindings of the mouse buttons.  For example, some people prefer using
       the left pointer button for dragging the scrollbar thumb.  That can be
       set up by altering the translations resource, e.g.,

           *VT100.scrollbar.translations:  #override \n\
              &lt;Btn5Down&gt;:     StartScroll(Forward) \n\
              &lt;Btn1Down&gt;:     StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
              &lt;Btn4Down&gt;:     StartScroll(Backward) \n\
              &lt;Btn1Motion&gt;:   MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
              &lt;BtnUp&gt;:        NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()

<h2><a name="h2-CONTROL-SEQUENCES-AND-KEYBOARD" id="h2-CONTROL-SEQUENCES-AND-KEYBOARD">CONTROL SEQUENCES AND KEYBOARD</a></h2>
<pre>       Applications can send sequences of characters to the terminal to change
       its behavior.  Often they are referred to as "ANSI escape sequences" or
       just plain "escape sequences" but both terms are misleading:

       <b>o</b>   ANSI x3.64 (obsolete) which was replaced by ISO 6429 (<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards//ecma-48/"><b>ECMA-48</b></a>) gave
           rules for the <i>format</i> of these sequences of characters.

       <b>o</b>   While the original VT100 was claimed to be ANSI-compatible (against
           x3.64), there is no freely available version of the ANSI standard
           to show where the VT100 differs.  Most of the documents which
           mention the ANSI standard have additions not found in the original
           (such as those based on <b>ansi.sys</b>).  So this discussion focuses on
           the ISO standards.

       <b>o</b>   The standard describes only sequences sent from the host to the
           terminal.  There is no standard for sequences sent by special keys
           from the terminal to the host.  By convention (and referring to
           existing terminals), the format of those sequences usually conforms
           to the host-to-terminal standard.

       <b>o</b>   Some of <i>xterm</i>'s sequences do not fit into the standard scheme.
           Technically those are "unspecified".  As an example, DEC Screen
           Alignment Test (DECALN) is this three-character sequence:

               <i>ESC</i> # 8

       <b>o</b>   Some sequences fit into the standard format, but are not listed in
           the standard.  These include the sequences used for setting up
           scrolling margins and doing forward/reverse scrolling.

       <b>o</b>   Some of the sequences (in particular, the single-character
           functions such as tab and backspace) do not include the <i>escape</i>
           character.

       With all of that in mind, the standard refers to these sequences of
       characters as "control sequences".

       <i>Xterm Control Sequences</i> lists the control sequences which an
       application can send <i>xterm</i> to make it perform various operations.  Most
       of these operations are standardized, from either the DEC or Tektronix
       terminals, or from more widely used standards such as ISO-6429.

       A few examples of usage are given in this section.

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-Window-and-Icon-Titles" id="h3-Window-and-Icon-Titles">Window and Icon Titles</a></h3>
<pre>       Some scripts use <b>echo</b> with options <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-e">-e</a></b> and <b><a href="#Old-Options:-n">-n</a></b> to tell the shell to
       interpret the string "\e" as the <i>escape</i> character and to suppress a
       trailing newline on output.  Those are not portable, nor recommended.
       Instead, use <b>printf</b> (POSIX).

       For example, to set the <i>window title</i> to "Hello world!", you could use
       one of these commands in a script:

           printf '\033]2;Hello world!\033\\'
           printf '\033]2;Hello world!\007'
           printf '\033]2;%s\033\\' "Hello world!"
           printf '\033]2;%s\007' "Hello world!"

       The <b>printf</b> command interprets the octal value "\033" for <i>escape</i>, and
       (since it was not given in the format) omits a trailing newline from
       the output.

       Some programs (such as <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html"><b>screen(1)</b></a>) set both window- and icon-titles at
       the same time, using a slightly different control sequence:

           printf '\033]0;Hello world!\033\\'
           printf '\033]0;Hello world!\007'
           printf '\033]0;%s\033\\' "Hello world!"
           printf '\033]0;%s\007' "Hello world!"

       The difference is the <i>parameter</i> "0" in each command.  Most window
       managers will honor either window title or icon title.  Some will make
       a distinction and allow you to set just the icon title.  You can tell
       <i>xterm</i> to ask for this with a different parameter in the control
       sequence:

           printf '\033]1;Hello world!\033\\'
           printf '\033]1;Hello world!\007'
           printf '\033]1;%s\033\\' "Hello world!"
           printf '\033]1;%s\007' "Hello world!"

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-Special-Keys" id="h3-Special-Keys">Special Keys</a></h3>
<pre>       <i>Xterm</i>, like any VT100-compatible terminal emulator, has two modes for
       the <i>special keys</i> (cursor-keys, numeric keypad, and certain function-
       keys):

       <b>o</b>   <i>normal mode</i>, which makes the special keys transmit "useful"
           sequences such as the control sequence for cursor-up when pressing
           the up-arrow, and

       <b>o</b>   <i>application mode</i>, which uses a different control sequence that
           cannot be mistaken for the "useful" sequences.

       The main difference between the two modes is that normal mode sequences
       start with <i>CSI</i> (<i>escape [</i>) and application mode sequences start with <i>SS3</i>
       (<i>escape O</i>).

       The terminal is initialized into one of these two modes (usually the
       normal mode), based on the terminal description (termcap or terminfo).
       The terminal description also has capabilities (strings) defined for
       the keypad mode used in curses applications.

       There is a problem in using the terminal description for applications
       that are not intended to be full-screen curses applications: the
       definitions of special keys are only correct for this keypad mode.  For
       example, some shells (unlike <a href="http://cdesktopenv.sourceforge.net/man1/ksh.html"><b>ksh(1)</b></a>, which appears to be hard-coded,
       not even using termcap) allow their users to customize key-bindings,
       assigning shell actions to special keys.

       <b>o</b>   <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html"><b>bash(1)</b></a> allows <i>constant</i> strings to be assigned to functions.  This
           is only successful if the terminal is initialized to application
           mode by default, because <b>bash</b> lacks flexibility in this area.  It
           uses a (less expressive than <b>bash</b>'s) <b>readline</b> scripting language
           for setting up key bindings, which relies upon the user to
           statically enumerate the possible bindings for given values of
           <b>$TERM</b>.

       <b>o</b>   <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/zsh_toc.html"><b>zsh(1)</b></a> provides an analogous feature, but it accepts runtime
           expressions, as well as providing a <b>$terminfo</b> array for scripts.
           In particular, one can use the terminal database, transforming when
           defining a key-binding.  By transforming the output so that <i>CSI</i> and
           <i>SS3</i> are equated, <b>zsh</b> can use the terminal database to obtain useful
           definitions for its command-line use regardless of whether the
           terminal uses normal or application mode initially.  Here is an
           example:

               [[ "$terminfo[kcuu1]" == "^[O"* ]] &amp;&amp; \
               bindkey -M viins "${terminfo[kcuu1]/O/[}" \
               vi-up-line-or-history

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-Changing-Colors" id="h3-Changing-Colors">Changing Colors</a></h3>
<pre>       A few shell programs provide the ability for users to add color and
       other video attributes to the shell prompt strings.  Users can do this
       by setting <b>$PS1</b> (the primary prompt string).  Again, <b>bash</b> and <b>zsh</b> have
       provided features not found in <b>ksh</b>.  There is a problem, however: the
       prompt's width on the screen will not necessarily be the same as the
       number of characters.  Because there is no guidance in the POSIX
       standard, each shell addresses the problem in a different way:

       <b>o</b>   <b>bash</b> treats characters within "\[" and "\]" as nonprinting (using
           no width on the screen).

       <b>o</b>   <b>zsh</b> treats characters within "%{" and "%}" as nonprinting.

       In addition to the difference in syntax, the shells provide different
       methods for obtaining useful escape sequences:

       <b>o</b>   As noted in <b><a href="#h3-Special-Keys">Special Keys</a></b>, <b>zsh</b> initializes the $terminfo array with
           the terminal capabilities.

           It also provides a function <b>echoti</b> which works like <a href="/ncurses/man/tput.1.html"><b>tput(1)</b></a> to
           convert a terminal capability with its parameters into a string
           that can be written to the terminal.

       <b>o</b>   Shells lacking a comparable feature (such as <b>bash</b>) can always use
           the program <b>tput</b> to do this transformation.

       Hard-coded escape sequences are supported by each shell, but are not
       recommended because those rely upon particular configurations and
       cannot be easily moved between different user environments.

</pre>
<h2><a name="h2-ENVIRONMENT" id="h2-ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h2>
<pre>       <i>Xterm</i> sets several environment variables.

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-System-Independent" id="h3-System-Independent">System Independent</a></h3>
<pre>       Some variables are used on every system:

       <b><a title="System Independent:DISPLAY" name="System-Independent:DISPLAY">DISPLAY</a></b>
            is the display name, pointing to the X server (see <i>DISPLAY NAMES</i>
            in <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man7/X.7.xhtml"><b>X(7)</b></a>).

       <b><a title="System Independent:TERM" name="System-Independent:TERM">TERM</a></b>
            is set according to the terminfo (or termcap) entry which it is
            using as a reference.

            On some systems, you may encounter situations where the shell
            which you use and <i>xterm</i> are built using libraries with different
            terminal databases.  In that situation, <i>xterm</i> may choose a
            terminal description not known to the shell.

       <b><a title="System Independent:WINDOWID" name="System-Independent:WINDOWID">WINDOWID</a></b>
            is set to the X window id number of the <i>xterm</i> window.

       <b><a title="System Independent:XTERM_FILTER" name="System-Independent:XTERM_FILTER">XTERM_FILTER</a></b>
            is set if a locale-filter is used.  The value is the pathname of
            the filter.

       <b><a title="System Independent:XTERM_LOCALE" name="System-Independent:XTERM_LOCALE">XTERM_LOCALE</a></b>
            shows the locale which was used by <i>xterm</i> on startup.  Some shell
            initialization scripts may set a different locale.

       <b><a title="System Independent:XTERM_SHELL" name="System-Independent:XTERM_SHELL">XTERM_SHELL</a></b>
            is set to the pathname of the program which is invoked.  Usually
            that is a shell program, e.g., <i>/bin/sh</i>.  Since it is not
            necessarily a shell program however, it is distinct from "SHELL".

       <b><a title="System Independent:XTERM_VERSION" name="System-Independent:XTERM_VERSION">XTERM_VERSION</a></b>
            is set to the string displayed by the <b><a href="#OPTIONS:-version">-version</a></b> option.  That is
            normally an identifier for the X Window libraries used to build
            <i>xterm</i>, followed by <i>xterm</i>'s patch number in parenthesis.  The patch
            number is also part of the response to a Secondary Device
            Attributes (DA) control sequence (see <i>Xterm Control Sequences</i>).

</pre>
<h3><a name="h3-System-Dependent" id="h3-System-Dependent">System Dependent</a></h3>
<pre>       Depending on your system configuration, <i>xterm</i> may also set the
       following:

       <b><a title="System Dependent:COLUMNS" name="System-Dependent:COLUMNS">COLUMNS</a></b>
            the width of the <i>xterm</i> in characters (cf: "stty columns").

            When this variable is set, <i>curses</i> applications (and most terminal
            programs) will assume that the terminal has this many columns.

            <i>Xterm</i> would do this for systems which have no ability to tell the
            size of the terminal.  Those are very rare, none newer than the
            mid 1990s when SVR4 became prevalent.

       <b><a title="System Dependent:HOME" name="System-Dependent:HOME">HOME</a></b>
            when <i>xterm</i> is configured (at build-time) to update utmp.

       <b><a title="System Dependent:LINES" name="System-Dependent:LINES">LINES</a></b>
            the height of the <i>xterm</i> in characters (cf: "stty rows").

            When this variable is set, <i>curses</i> applications (and most terminal
            programs) will assume that the terminal has this many lines
            (rows).

            <i>Xterm</i> would do this for systems which have no ability to tell the
            size of the terminal.  Those are very rare, none newer than the
            mid 1990s when SVR4 became prevalent.

       <b><a title="System Dependent:LOGNAME" name="System-Dependent:LOGNAME">LOGNAME</a></b>
            when <i>xterm</i> is configured (at build-time) to update utmp.

            Your configuration may have set <b><a href="#System-Dependent:LOGNAME">LOGNAME</a></b>; <i>xterm</i> does not modify
            that.  If it is unset, <i>xterm</i> will use <b>USER</b> if it is set.  Finally,
            if neither is set, <i>xterm</i> will use the <b><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getlogin.html">getlogin(3)</a></b> function.

       <b><a title="System Dependent:SHELL" name="System-Dependent:SHELL">SHELL</a></b>
            when <i>xterm</i> is configured (at build-time) to update utmp.  It is
            also set if you provide a valid shell name as the optional
            parameter.

            <i>Xterm</i> sets this to an absolute pathname.  If you have set the
            variable to a relative pathname, <i>xterm</i> may set it to a different
            shell pathname.

            If you have set this to an pathname which does not correspond to a
            valid shell, <i>xterm</i> may unset it, to avoid confusion.

       <b><a title="System Dependent:TERMCAP" name="System-Dependent:TERMCAP">TERMCAP</a></b>
            the contents of the termcap entry corresponding to <b>$TERM</b>, with
            lines and columns values substituted for the actual size window
            you have created.

            This feature is, like <b><a href="#System-Dependent:LINES">LINES</a></b> and <b><a href="#System-Dependent:COLUMNS">COLUMNS</a></b>, used rarely.  It
            addresses the same limitation of a few older systems by providing
            a way for <i>termcap</i>-based applications to get the initial screen
            size.

       <b><a title="System Dependent:TERMINFO" name="System-Dependent:TERMINFO">TERMINFO</a></b>
            may be defined to a nonstandard location using the configure
            script.

<h2><a name="h2-BUGS" id="h2-BUGS">BUGS</a></h2>
<pre>       Large pastes do not work on some systems.  This is not a bug in <i>xterm</i>;
       it is a bug in the pseudo terminal driver of those systems.  <i>Xterm</i>
       feeds large pastes to the pty only as fast as the pty will accept data,
       but some pty drivers do not return enough information to know if the
       write has succeeded.

       When connected to an input method, it is possible for <i>xterm</i> to hang if
       the XIM server is suspended or killed.

       Many of the options are not resettable after <i>xterm</i> starts.

       This program still needs to be rewritten.  It should be split into very
       modular sections, with the various emulators being completely separate
       widgets that do not know about each other.  Ideally, you'd like to be
       able to pick and choose emulator widgets and stick them into a single
       control widget.

       There needs to be a dialog box to allow entry of the Tek COPY file
       name.

<h2><a name="h2-AUTHORS" id="h2-AUTHORS">AUTHORS</a></h2>
<pre>       Far too many people.

       These contributed to the X Consortium: Loretta Guarino Reid (DEC-UEG-
       WSL), Joel McCormack (DEC-UEG-WSL), Terry Weissman (DEC-UEG-WSL),
       Edward Moy (Berkeley), Ralph R. Swick (MIT-Athena), Mark Vandevoorde

       (Stellar), Ron Newman (MIT-Athena), Jim Fulton (MIT X Consortium), Dave
       Serisky (HP), Jonathan Kamens (MIT-Athena).

       Beginning with XFree86, there were far more identifiable contributors.
       The <i>THANKS</i> file in <i>xterm</i>'s source lists 243 in June 2022.  Keep in mind
       these: Jason Bacon, Jens Schweikhardt, Ross Combs, Stephen P. Wall,

       <i>X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language Interface</i> (<a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xtoolkit/xtoolkit.html"><b>Xt</b></a>),
       Joel McCormack, Paul Asente, Ralph R. Swick (1994),
       Thomas E. Dickey (2019).

       <i>Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</i> (<a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/xorg-docs/icccm/icccm.html"><b>ICCCM</b></a>),

       <i>Extended Window Manager Hints</i> (<a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html"><b>EWMH</b></a>),
       X Desktop Group (version 1.3, 2005).

       EWMH uses <i>UTF8_STRING</i> pervasively without defining it, but does mention
       the ICCCM.  Version 2.0 of the ICCCM does not address UTF-8.   That  is
       an extension added in XFree86.

       <b>o</b>   Markus Kuhn summarized this in <i>UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ for Unix/Linux</i>
           (2001), in the section "Is X11 ready for Unicode?"

       <b>o</b>   Juliusz Chroboczek  proposed  the  UTF8_STRING  selection  atom  in
           1999/2000, which became part of the ICCCM in XFree86.

           <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/UTF8_STRING/">https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/UTF8_STRING/</a>

           An  Xorg  developer  removed that part of the documentation in 2004
           when incorporating other work from XFree86 into Xorg.  The  feature
           is still supported in Xorg, though undocumented as of 2019.
