  <h2 id="icon_origin-toc"><a name="icon_origin" id=
  "icon_origin">In the beginning</a></h2>

  <p>There were X icons, but generally not closely associated with
  specific applications (aside from name) and except for commercial
  enterprises, not having a particular style.</p>

  <p>Users would select icons that looked nice, and would (if so
  inclined) spend time customizing their X environment.</p>

  <p>Not all window managers do anything with icons. Fvwm can
  display icons, but <strong>xterm</strong>'s active icon feature
  is more useful than any of the predefined icons. Fvwm also is
  efficient, unlike the desktop environments.</p>

  <p>I used fvwm as my default window manager for quite a while
  (until 2010, when it turned out that fvwm had no way to adjust to
  the different display sizes in my current environment). Other
  window managers (and desktops using them) were of interest only
  to investigate bugs in their interaction with
  <strong>xterm</strong>.</p>

  <p>The pictures on this page show 48x48 icons (scaled to
  144x144). At this time, those are still considered large icons.
  Perhaps in another ten years that will be the smallest size.</p>

  <h2 id="desktop_226-toc"><a name="desktop_226" id=
  "desktop_226">Adding a desktop-file</a></h2>

  <p>I noticed that Redhat's package for <strong>xterm</strong> had
  added a desktop-file, but (from bug-reports) there was no icon
  for it. So I added corresponding files in <a href=
  "xterm.log.html#xterm_226">patch #226</a> (mid-2007).</p>

  <p>Using one of the KDE or GNOME icons of course was out of the
  question due to licensing and reuse issues. The X sources did
  have an icon which was a good starting point:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/xterm/images/icons-terminal.png" alt=
    "X terminal icon"></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is easily recognizable, and in contrast to the other icons
  is reasonably unambiguous. What it lacked was an explicit
  association with <strong>xterm</strong>. So I modified that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/xterm/images/icons-xterm_226.png" alt=
    "XTerm icon"></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To complete the change, I added a colored icon:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/xterm/images/icons-xterm-color_226.png" alt=
    "XTerm color-icon"></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I created 32x32 and 48x48 <em>xpm</em> (X pixmap) files using
  gimp. At that time, the <em>xpm</em> files were sufficient. I
  chose the background to work with Redhat's muted (read "mud")
  backgrounds.</p>

  <p>Given the large images which I provide here (scaled up from
  48x48), you may be concerned about the low-resolution. But that
  was not an issue when I made these changes in 2007. Referring to
  a CentOS 4 system, I see that while I could add a small 16x16
  icon to the GNOME panel, there was no provision for using the
  48x48 icon on the desktop. That came later.</p>

  <h2 id="icon_svg_281-toc"><a name="icon_svg_281" id=
  "icon_svg_281">Redrawing the icons</a></h2>

  <p>The large image of a terminal-icon at the top of this page
  uses a non-transparent background. While it is suitable for the
  webpage, it is not a good choice for the desktop icons. That is
  because icons can be put onto the desktop, which can have a
  background image. The smaller icons can also be put into places
  where the filled background does not mesh with its
  surroundings.</p>

  <p>The images at the top of the page also are not jagged. That is
  because I redrew the icons in <em>svg</em> format using inkscape
  in <a href="/xterm/xterm.log.html#xterm_281">patch #281</a>
  (mid-2012). Here are the monochrome:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/xterm/images/icons-xterm_281.png" alt=
    "XTerm scalable monochome-icon"></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and colored icons:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/xterm/images/icons-xterm-color_281.png" alt=
    "XTerm scalable color-icon"></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is no automatic way to translate the <em>xpm</em> file
  into <em>svg</em>. Or rather, there is&mdash;one can "always"
  import bitmaps into the scalable icon image. The result is often
  poor; although that did not stop some of the desktops from
  delivering icons done that way.</p>

  <p>I chose to redraw the icons rather than tweaking bitmaps.</p>

  <p>Redrawing the icons was only part of the process. The new
  icons are installed in different directories. Making the process
  work on several different platforms (I've about 40 virtual
  machines at hand) takes time.</p>

  <h2 id="icon_svg_282-toc"><a name="icon_svg_282" id=
  "icon_svg_282">Drawing a new icon</a></h2>

  <p>After completing patch #281, I worked on <a href=
  "/vile/vile.html">vile</a> for a while. I was reminded at this
  point that I had neglected the window decoration icon of
  <strong>xterm</strong>. That is the small icon which appears at
  the upper left corner of the terminal window. Back in the day
  when one could count on <em>all</em> of the icons from the X
  distribution to be installed, one could also take for granted
  that the <strong>X</strong> icon would be available for this
  purpose.</p>

  <p>Not so. Bring your own.</p>

  <p>I found that scaling <strong>xterm</strong>'s icon down for
  this size made it hard to distinguish. So I made a new icon,
  which is distinct. That is the "T" superimposed on an "X" which
  you see here:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/xterm/images/mini.xterm_256.png" alt=
    "MiniXTerm icon"></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I refer to it as the "mini" icon, since it is analogous to the
  <a href="/vile/vile-icons.html">mini-icon</a> provided in
  vile.</p>

  <p>I added images of xterm's new mini-icon, and an interim
  version of the #281 icon (with the same background as the pixmap
  icon) August 22, 2012 to my xterm pages after verifying that
  there was no pre-existing use.</p>

  <p>I made all of xterm's icons available with <a href=
  "xterm.log.html#xterm_282">patch #282</a>. With this version,
  either icon can be configured for the desktop use.</p>

  <h2 id="icon_summary-toc"><a name="icon_summary" id=
  "icon_summary">Summary</a></h2>

  <p>Test your eyesight. From left to right, the icons described
  here are repeated as 48x48 images:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/xterm/images/demo-terminal.png" alt=
    "X terminal pixmap icon"> <img src=
    "/xterm/images/demo-xterm_226.png" alt="XTerm pixmap icon">
    <img src="images/demo-xterm-color_226.png" alt=
    "XTerm pixmap color-icon"> <img src=
    "/xterm/images/demo-xterm_281.png" alt="XTerm scalable icon">
    <img src="images/demo-xterm-color_281.png" alt=
    "XTerm scalable color-icon"> <img src=
    "images/mini.xterm_48.png" alt=
    "XTerm newer scalable color-icon"></p>
  </blockquote>
