  <p>I got involved with <strong>Lynx</strong> development by
  working with Jim Spath on an <a href=
  "/lynx/lynx-autoconf.html">auto-configure</a> script for
  <strong>Lynx</strong>. I have also made <a href=
  "/lynx/lynx-ncurses.html">changes</a> for <strong>Lynx</strong>
  that allow you to build it using the color support in the ncurses
  library. Since the release of <strong>Lynx</strong> 2.8 in early
  1998, I have been acting as the patch coordinator for a group of
  people (including myself) doing ongoing development on
  <strong>Lynx</strong>. Besides ongoing support for the configure
  script, etc., I have done work to make lynx more robust (e.g.,
  <a href="/lynx/lynx-security.html">secure</a>).</p>

  <p>Very early development of <strong>Lynx</strong> (during the
  1990s) used no source control. You may find old tar/zip files,
  e.g., on public servers:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><a href=
      "http://www.nic.funet.fi/index/WWW/lynx/">http://www.nic.funet.fi/index/WWW/lynx/</a></li>

      https://ftp.zx.net.nz/pub/archive/ftp.sunfreeware.com/pub/freeware/forsunsites/lists.html</a></li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Over most of its development, <strong>Lynx</strong>'s sources
  were stored on isc.org in <a href=
  "http://prcs.sourceforge.net">PRCS archives</a>. Klaus Weide set
  up PRCS 1.1.1 in 1997 on a previous host (slcc.edu). Jim Spath
  and I migrated this to <a href="http://isc.org">isc.org</a> in
  1999 (using PRCS 1.2.15).</p>

  <p>Each commit in PRCS became a patch-release for
  <strong>Lynx</strong>.</p>

  <p>Our version numbering for <strong>Lynx</strong> has confused
  some people. PRCS provides for having a non-numeric portion of a
  branch identifier. We used this for cycling through the
  development, pre-release and release versions. The first patch
  towards the <em>next</em> release would be marked with that
  target release's version. Thus</p>

  <ul>
    <li>2.8.7 was (as of mid-2010) the most recent release.</li>

    <li>2.8.8dev.5 was a development patch <em>before</em> the
    2.8.8 release.</li>

    <li>2.8.8pre.1 was projected to be a pre-release.</li>

    <li>2.8.8rel.1 would be a release. Subsequent urgent fixes
    would be 2.8.8rel.2, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Since starting work on Lynx in 1997, I have also maintained my
  local archives in RCS. Originally, this recorded only the
  patch-releases of <strong>Lynx</strong> in PRCS. There were a few
  reasons for this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the numbering of the patch releases is simple (users can
    tell which is next),</li>

    <li>for the first few years of my involvement, there was more
    than one person concurrently making commits (Foteos Macrides,
    Klaus Weide and me). We each collected changes and committed a
    combined set of changes for our commits.</li>

    <li>the PRCS archive was the master repository for
    <strong>Lynx</strong>. There was no point in having two.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, since early 2004, I committed most changes first to
  RCS, then applied the current change-set to PRCS. The end result
  is much the same; PRCS assigns the patch-version number in a few
  files, while most are marked with the "LynxId" RCS-tag. It allows
  me to keep closer track of individual changes.</p>

  <p>Further (as of 2015), since we left isc.org, I make patches
  and releases directly from my RCS archives, rather than using
  PRCS as an intermediate step. I dropped PRCS because its
  developer has not maintained it for several years, and the
  published source does not build or work with current C++
  compilers. A few others have worked to revive PRCS, but in the
  process have lost compatibility with older versions of the
  tool.</p>

  <p>Currently (as of 2023), I am simplifying the versioning by
  eliminating the PRCS-dependent <em>dev</em>, <em>pre</em> and
  <em>rel</em> tags, because the user community views each phase of
  Lynx's versions as stable (see mailing list <a href=
  "https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/lynx-dev/2022-11/msg00005.html">
  comment</a>).</p>

  <p>Initially of course Lynx was developed (and hosted) at the
  University of Kansas.</p>

  <p>It had moved to Salt Lake City College by the time I started
  working on Lynx, early in 1997. Its unofficial sponsor was Scott
  McGee, a systems administrator.</p>

  <p>Paul Vixie offered support early in 1999, when asked by Jim
  Spath. Quoting from Jim Spath's mail to the "list elves"
  group:</p>

&gt; no charge for any of this of course.  i use lynx every day and i love it. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I help maintain the Lynx software distribution (a text-based web 
&gt; &gt; browser). We are looking for a generous host who could provide space for 
&gt; &gt; copies of the latest version. Right now, the tar.gz file is under 2MB, 
&gt; &gt; and we have also build .zip, .bz2 and tar.Z copies. If you can make some 
&gt; &gt; space available, plese write back. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Thanks! 
 
Terrific! 
 
Some background in case you're not subscribed to the lynx-dev list. We 
store our distribution at Salt Lake Community College as guest of the 
system administrator (www.slcc.edu/lynx). Sometimes their bandwidth is 
poor, and as guests we can't complain about their support.  We use PRCS 
as software checkin repository. 
 
One of our contributors (Rob Partington) has registered lynx.browser.org 
as our "parent" domain. That basically hosts a vanilla page that points 
to Lynx resources. Other contributors include patches on their own 
sites. 
 
Ideally, it would be great to use one of your servers as the central 
Lynx repository, both web and FTP. Other sites could mirror from you (I 
know you're well connected :-).  This would alleviate us out-staying our 
welcome at SLCC.  Perhaps we could add to the browser.org domain with 
something like ftp.lynx.browser.org?  
 
If this is too much to ask, we could certainly use one of your servers 
as a FTP mirror. 
 
Again, thanks for your offer!

  <p>The support was good, though Lynx was not as large as some of
  the projects which ISC hosted.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Early on, Lynx was mentioned on ISC's home page (see
      archive for <a href=
      "https://web.archive.org/web/20000303022801/http://www.isc.org/services/public/sites-hosted.html">
      March 3, 2000</a>).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Later, the list of supported projects was moved to a
      separate page (see archive for <a href=
      "https://web.archive.org/web/20030402142116/http://isc.org/services/public/sites-hosted.html">
      April 2, 2003</a>).</p>
    </li>

    <li>Still (a little later), the list of supported projects was
    mentioned only in a short history page, seen in <a href=
    "https://web.archive.org/web/20040304175337/http://www.isc.org/">
    April 2004</a>.<br>
    At that point, Lynx was no longer directly linked from ISC's
    pages.</li>

    <li>
      <p>Lynx was still mentioned in the history page from <a href=
      "https://web.archive.org/web/20130507101801/https://www.isc.org/about/history">
      May 7, 2013</a>.<br>
      Paul Vixie was still with the ISC at that point (see <a href=
      "https://web.archive.org/web/20130426152927/https://www.isc.org/isc-team">
      archive</a>).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, things change. Paul Vixie left ISC in <a href=
  "http://www.isc.org/blogs/isc-spins-off-its-security-business-unit/">
  mid-2013</a> to form a new company. <a href=
  "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/internet-systems-consortium-renews-commitment-130000421.html">
  At the time</a>, that did not affect Lynx&mdash;from ISC's
  standpoint Lynx was just a box in a rack of servers. For the last
  four years of Lynx's stay at ISC, I did all of the software
  maintenance for the project. Still, a box in a rack costs money
  for electricity. Late in 2015, ISC shifted away from this style
  of project support, to reduce costs. I expanded my website to
  incorporate Lynx (roughly doubling the size of the site).</p>
