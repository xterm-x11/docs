  <h2 id="synopsis-h2"><a name="synopsis" id=
  "synopsis">Synopsis</a></h2>

  <p><strong>Vttest</strong> tests the compatibility (demonstrates
  the non-compatibility) of so-called
  &ldquo;VT100-compatible&rdquo; terminals. In conformance of the
  good old hacker traditions, the only documentation of this
  program is the source code itself. To understand it, you also
  need a copy of the original VT100 manual from DEC.</p>

  <p>Additional tests (past version 1.7) are provided for analysis
  of vt220 through vt520 terminals, as well as variants of
  xterm.</p>

  <h2 id="history-h2"><a name="history" id="history">History</a></h2>

  <p><strong>Vttest</strong> was written in 1983-1985 by Per
  Lindberg at the Stockholm University Computing Center. The last
  version was 1.7b (1985-04-19). Per Lindberg later distributed
  1.7b via the Usenet mod.sources group (Volume 7, Issue 16,
  September 2, 1986). It became an established part of the Unix
  source archives, e.g,. as noted in <a href=
  "https://web.archive.org/web/20120221203921/http://www.skytel.co.cr/unix-source-code/research/1988/0419.html">
  these postings</a> from 1988.</p>

  <p>I began this version in <a href=
  "http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/utils/console/vttest.lsm">May
  1996</a> (starting with 1.7b) to support changes that I am making
  to <a href="/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a>. The program has grown
  from about 2400 lines to more than 18,000 lines of code. See the
  changelog for details.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="CHANGES">plain text</a></li>

    <li><a href="CHANGES.html">changes in html format</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>I changed the version number to 2.0 in the <a href=
  "http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/utils/console/vttest.lsm">initial
  release</a>, in 1996, and went up to 2.7 shortly after. Since
  then, the patch-date is the effective version number.</p>

  <p>Most of my visible changes are via two menu entries at the
  bottom of the main screen:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="/vttest/images/VTTEST-main%20menu.png"><img width=
    "450" src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-main%20menu.png" alt=
    "Main menu of VTTEST"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>However, I restructured the entire program, adding screens to
  existing tests, and menu entries (for instance in the terminal
  reports). In the restructured program, it is much simpler to add
  menu entries, since they are built from tables rather than case
  statements.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, I kept the overall indentation style of the
  program. There are no tab characters.</p>

  <h3>Color</h3>

  <p>VT100's never did color.</p>

  <p>My original motivation for working on vttest was to provide a
  way to test the color changes I was making for xterm. Drawing
  colored text is straightforward. Drawing colored backgrounds
  presents many choices. For instance:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>which control sequences can erase the screen, restoring the
    original background.</li>

    <li>which control sequences can erase the screen, retaining the
    current original background.</li>

    <li>do the different control sequences for erasing the screen,
    erasing above/below the cursor position, erasing all or part of
    the current line have the same effect on the background
    color.</li>

    <li>how is the color determined for the background when
    scrolling up (or down).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>None of those choices are automatically "right" or "wrong".
  Designers of different terminals (and emulators) have chosen to
  implement color in different ways.</p>

  <p>For xterm, I chose to match the Linux console behavior. That
  was a starting point. But (see below) I continued past this
  point, implementing features from VT220 and later, including
  controls (DECSCA) that can protect against erasure.</p>

  <p>The particular erasure choices used in xterm and Linux console
  are modeled in ncurses as the back color erase (bce) feature.
  Early on, we (I and Alexander V. Lukyanov) found that the bce
  feature was nowhere defined precisely, and settled on the current
  behavior. Other terminals (such as rxvt) do not exactly match
  this set of choices, so controls which differ are not in the
  corresponding terminal description.</p>

  <p>I added screens to vttest to illustrate the bce behavior,
  helping to ensure consistency.</p>

  <p>For instance, this was once of the earlier screens I wrote to
  demonstrate and test erases against the bce color model:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <table summary="BCE Test using ECH">
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><a href=
        "/vttest/images/VTTEST-BCE%20before.png"><img width="450"
        src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-BCE%20before.png" alt=
        "BCE Test &ndash; Before"></a>
        </td>
        <td><a href=
        "/vttest/images/VTTEST-BCE%20after.png"><img width="450"
        src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-BCE%20after.png" alt=
        "BCE Test &ndash; After"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <th>Before Erase</th>
        <th>After Erase</th>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The terminal also has to fill color properly for double-sized
  characters. Here are examples with and without font support for
  double-sized characters:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <table summary="Double-sized characters with color">
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><a href=
        "/vttest/images/VTTEST-double%20width%20color.png"><img width="450"
        src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-double%20width%20color.png" alt=
        "Color &ndash; With scaled fonts"></a>
        </td>
        <td><a href=
        "/vttest/images/VTTEST-NO%20double-sized%20color.png"><img width="450"
        src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-NO%20double-sized%20color.png"
        alt="Color &ndash; Without scaled fonts"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <th>Using scaled fonts</th>
        <th>Without scaled fonts</th>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Even Linux console has had occasional issues, where it is
  inconsistent, e.g., a blunder in 2008 as reported on the Linux
  kernel mailing list <a href=
  "http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/3/66">here</a> by Alexander V.
  Lukyanov. The problem was introduced <a href=
  "http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/26/305">here</a>, and <a href=
  "https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=418613">broke the
  bce feature</a> of Linux console for several months. Vttest might
  have been useful in that case. 
  <!-- TODO screenshots showing the one for protected areas
  --></p>

  <h3>Character Sets</h3>

  <p>Double-sized characters required some work on xterm.
  Initially, it only drew normal sized characters with spaces in
  between (and there were a few issues to resolve). Xterm now draws
  double-sized characters using scaled fonts (a feature introduced
  by XFree86). Here is an example from the VT100 tests:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=
    "/vttest/images/VTTEST-double-sized%20characters.png"><img width="450"
    src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-double-sized%20characters.png" alt=
    "VT100 Double-sized Character Test"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After I had been working on vttest for a while, I realized
  that xterm had features (other than the obvious case of function
  keys) that were not found in a VT100. These control sequences
  switch to a different character set for just one character (a
  single shift) or until undone (locking shifts). The VT100
  line-drawing characters are a special case of the latter.</p>

  <p>The set of single- and locking-shifts are features of the more
  advanced VT220 terminal. Seeing that, and understanding that it
  would allow xterm to be more useful to people around the world, I
  decided to fill in the missing pieces to make a workable VT220
  emulator. Years later, of course, UTF-8 became a more valued
  feature. But I use different programs than vttest for testing
  xterm's UTF-8 support.</p>

  <p>Some of the features (in particular the character sets) are
  visible only when the terminal identifies itself as a VT220 or
  above. For instance, the top-level menu "Test of character sets"
  shows only the VT100 character sets for VT100s:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=
    "/vttest/images/VTTEST-VT100%20character%20sets.png"><img width="480"
    src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-VT100%20character%20sets.png" alt=
    "VT100 Character Sets"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But for VT220s (e.g., xterm with the command line option
  "<code>-ti&nbsp;220</code>"), vttest shows a menu, with the VT100
  character sets as an option:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=
    "/vttest/images/VTTEST-character%20set%20choices%20above%20VT100.png">
    <img width="450" src=
    "/vttest/images/VTTEST-character%20set%20choices%20above%20VT100.png"
    alt="Character Set Choices Above VT100"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>VT220s provide something like ISO-2022 support for several
  European encodings. Here is an example using the locking shifts,
  showing French and Italian:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=
    "/vttest/images/VTTEST-locking%20shifts.png"><img width="450"
    src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-locking%20shifts.png" alt=
    "Example of VT220 Locking Shifts"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Incidentally, the VT220 and up can be switched into a mode
  where they identify themselves as lower-level models (analogous
  to the VT100/VT52 switching). You can do this in vttest using
  menu 12:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=
    "/vttest/images/VTTEST-modify%20test%20parameters.png"><img width="450"
    src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-modify%20test%20parameters.png" alt=
    "Menu for Modifying Test Parameters"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Linux console used to recognize 8-bit controls. I gave
  advice to Albert Cahalan (see <a href=
  "#link_discussion">links</a>), who used vttest to identify and
  repair most issues. However, later work to change the console
  driver to support UTF-8 broke that, though comments in the code
  still claimed that the feature was supported. Early in 2006, I
  submitted changes which were applied to the
  <em>console_codes</em> manpage, including the <a href=
  "http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/console_codes.4.html#BUGS">BUGS</a>
  section. This paragraph is pertinent:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre class="code-block">
    Some  older  kernel  versions  (after  2.0)  interpret  8-bit   control
    sequences.   These  "C1  controls"  use  codes  between  128 and 159 to
    replace ESC [, ESC ] and similar two-byte control sequence  initiators.
    There  are  fragments  of  that in modern kernels (either overlooked or
    broken by changes to support UTF-8), but the implementation  is  incom-
    plete and should be regarded as unreliable.
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>VT220 and Beyond</h3>

  <p>DEC's terminals were all upward-compatible:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The VT100 provided emulation of the VT52 (except for some
    differences of graphic characters).</li>

    <li>The VT220 recognized all of the VT100's controls.</li>

    <li>Subsequent models (VT320, VT420, VT520) recognized the
    predecessor's controls.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each model also provides more <em>new</em> features than the
  total in its predecessor. Not all features are useful for a
  terminal emulation (such as the dual-session feature of VT420). I
  have implemented tests for the features which either are in
  xterm, or are simple extensions (such as the variations on status
  responses).</p>

  <p>Vttest organizes these according to the terminal type.
  Features found in ISO 6429 but not in a particular DEC terminal
  are via separate menu choices from XTERM and the VT<em>xxx</em>
  flavors:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=
    "/vttest/images/VTTEST-non-VT100%20choices.png"><img width=
    "450" src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-non-VT100%20choices.png" alt=
    "Menu for non-VT100 Tests"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Early on, I found that ECH (erase character) is a VT220
  feature rather than VT102. It is perhaps the most commonly
  implemented extension of &ldquo;VT100 emulators&rdquo;.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="/vttest/images/VTTEST-ECH%20test.png"><img width=
    "450" src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-ECH%20test.png" alt=
    "Test for ECH (monochrome)"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As it is implemented in rxvt (unlike xterm and Linux console)
  it does not behave the same with regard to color as ED (erase
  display). After some discussion, it was determined that</p>

  <ul>
    <li>DEC implemented non-ANSI color controls for a few
    models.</li>

    <li>Those models treated the full-screen ED differently from
    line (EL) and character (ECH) erases.</li>

    <li>ANSI color as outlined in ISO 6429 was implemented by other
    manufacturers.</li>

    <li>ANSI color with DEC terminals is a feature of terminal
    emulators rather than the hardware implementations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, I recall using more than one terminal emulator
  with &ldquo;VT340&rdquo; and color, for instance TNVTPlus
  (developed by FTP Software, Inc.). That, by the way, differed
  from xterm regarding the way color was set when scrolling in
  "blank lines". There are as noted several choices, and none are
  blessed by an official standard. Vttest demonstrates the set of
  choices used in xterm and Linux console.</p>

  <p>Xterm implements several features from models past VT220. One
  of the more interesting is the ability to work with rectangles on
  the screen (from VT420). That is (both in vttest and xterm) only
  provided when the terminal identifies itself as (at least) a
  VT420:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <table summary="Test menu for Rectangles">
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><a href=
        "/vttest/images/VTTEST-VT100%20rectangle%20choices.png"><img width="450"
        src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-VT100%20rectangle%20choices.png"
        alt="Menu shown as a VT100"></a>
        </td>
        <td><a href=
        "/vttest/images/VTTEST-VT420%20rectangle%20choices.png"><img width="450"
        src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-VT420%20rectangle%20choices.png"
        alt="Menu shown as a VT420"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <th>As a VT100</th>
        <th>As a VT420</th>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Given the proper configuration, vttest shows rectangles. As an
  extension, xterm supports color:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <table summary="Example of Rectangle Test">
      <tr valign="top">
        <td><a href=
        "/vttest/images/VTTEST-monochrome%20rectangles.png"><img width="450"
        src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-monochrome%20rectangles.png"
        alt="Rectangle example (monochrome)"></a>
        </td>
        <td><a href=
        "/vttest/images/VTTEST-color%20rectangles%20example.png"><img width="450"
        src=
        "/vttest/images/VTTEST-color%20rectangles%20example.png"
        alt="Rectangle example (color)"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <th>Monochrome</th>
        <th>Color (XTerm)</th>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>ISO 6429 Features</h3>

  <p>ISO 6429 has several features (including scrolling not
  implemented by DEC terminals). The most useful set of tests is
  the color menu:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=
    "/vttest/images/VTTEST-ISO%206429%20color%20choices.png"><img width="450"
    src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-ISO%206429%20color%20choices.png"
    alt="Menu for ISO 6429 Color Tests"></a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <!-- comment on errors in documents - SD (ISO) vs SD (DEC) -->

  <h3>XTerm Features</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=
    "/vttest/images/VTTEST-XTerm%20choices.png"><img width="450"
    src="/vttest/images/VTTEST-XTerm%20choices.png" alt=
    "Tests for XTerm"></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The window modify- and report-operations attributed to
  <strong>dtterm</strong> (because that was the only extant usage
  in 1996) had appeared in the X10 "6.6b" version xterm. Like its
  successors through X11R6, there is no changelog, so it was not
  possible to determine when/where the features originated. But
  they predate <strong>dtterm</strong>. Some additional information
  is given in <a href=
  "/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-Miscellaneous"><em>XTerm Control
  Sequences</em></a>.</p>

  <h2 id="licensing-h2"><a name="licensing" id=
  "licensing">Licensing</a></h2>

  <p>The original distribution of vttest used licensing terms which
  were problematic ("noncommercial"), e.g., for the Debian
  packagers:</p>

  <blockquote>

  "link_sources">Other vttest Sources</a></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>FreeBSD (likewise NetBSD, OpenBSD) had a source (and
      typically installed vttest) as part of PCVT. The PCVT console
      driver is not much used now, but (like xterm of the same era)
      aimed at good VT220 emulation. <a href=
      "http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/stable/5/usr.sbin/pcvt/">Here</a>
      is a place to read about it.</p>

      <p><a href=
      "http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/stable/6/usr.sbin/">Since
      2005</a> (see also <a href=
      "http://manned.org/vttest/cba6d5b8">manned.org</a>), vttest
      has been provided as a port (not part of the base
      system).</p>

      <p>Recently (at least since 2009), FreeBSD has been revising
      the SYSCONS console driver (the "TEKEN_XTERM" feature seen
      <a href=
      "http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/sys/dev/syscons/">here</a>).
      As noted <a href=
      "http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/svn-src-head/2009-January/002980.html">
      here</a>, vttest has been useful in this development.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>rxvt used to have a bundled copy of 1.7b (see <a href=
      "http://rxvt.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rxvt/trunk/doc/">changes.txt</a>).<br>

      Mark Olesen dropped it from rxvt in his final release 2.18
      (announced August 2, 1996) to reflect my work on vttest.
      However, its presence in rxvt's source (combined with my
      having sent Mark a patch in April 1996 to improve rxvt's
      handling of SGR 39/49 default colors) was what led me to
      start adding the color-related tests to vttest.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>KDE konsole used to have a copy of 1.7b, which I noticed
      in 1.0.2 (2001) when responding to a <a href=
      "http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=121159">bug
      report</a> where konsole had incorrectly implemented xterm's
      SGR 1049 (no cursor save/restore was done). Ultimately it
      turned out that the bug had been fixed, but was poorly
      communicated since the corresponding <a href=
      "https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35650">upstream bug
      report</a> was not cited in Debian's update ("fix konsole"
      can cover a lot of territory), nor was there any changelog
      note in KDE describing the change.</p>

      <p>Vttest comprised most of the files in the "tests"
      subdirectory. It was removed in 2009, according to the commit
      comment due to <a href=
      "https://cgit.kde.org/konsole.git/commit/?id=602c1ce87ceaf1442e3329af1ff9aae40bbbaf73">
      "license issues/age"</a> (and is not mentioned in <a href=
      "http://konsole.kde.org/changelogfull.php">its
      changelog</a>).</p>

      <p>Konsole's copy had been modified, of course, to work with
      POSIX termio, although it was done inline (rather than moving
      the repeated ioctl's to a separate function). Seeing that
      vttest was apparently being used made it puzzling that at the
      time Konsole used a nonstandard response for its terminal
      identifier (the primary device attributes):</p>

      <blockquote>
        <pre class="code-block100">
  if (getMode(MODE_Ansi))
//  sendString("\033[?1;2c");     // I'm a VT100 with AP0 //FIXME: send only in response to ^[[0c
    sendString("\033[&gt;0;115;0c"); // I'm a VT220          //FIXME: send only in response to ^[[&gt;c
  else
    sendString("\033/Z");         // I'm a VT52
</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>That is, it was returning xterm's <em>secondary</em>
      response. The &ldquo;115&rdquo; was xterm's patch level in
      <a href="/xterm/xterm.log.html#xterm_115">late 1999</a>.
      However, that was partially corrected around the same time as
      the bug report&mdash; mentioned above. The string is (as of
      December 2011) returned as the response to the secondary
      device attributes control.</p>

      This is an example of how vttest is used to validate the
      correctness of a terminal.</p>

      <p>By the way, the comment "passes more suites" refers to an
      earlier source (apparently not available) whose writer was
      confused about xterm's support for double-sized characters,
      stating that Terminal.app did this while xterm did not.
      Xterm's done this since 1998. Since Terminal.app is an OS X
      application, it cannot be older than 2002.</p>

      <p>The existing article (from 2005) goes on to comment that
      Terminal.app does not handle mouse location reporting. That
      gives a clue: As of 2014, Terminal.app as a rule does not
      handle the VT220 and higher-level control sequences which
      comprise the bulk of the screens in vttest. It is not xterm.
      Perhaps its developers intended it to compete with dtterm,
      which it more closely resembled at that point in time.</p>

  <h3 id="link_tools-h3"><a name="link_tools" id=
  "link_tools">Test-tools</a></h3>

  <p>The <a href="#comment_sut"><em>System Under Test</em></a> page
  only skims the surface of testing a terminal.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href="/ncurses/tack.html">tack</a> is an interactive
      tool like vttest, used for testing terminal descriptions. A
      terminal description provides details about the most commonly
      used features (which applications and libraries such as
      ncurses may use portably).</p>

      <p>When I test a terminal description, I rely on vttest and
      tack and make notes on the problems found (see <a href=
      "/ncurses/ncurses.html#download_database">terminfo.src</a>
      for examples)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The <a href=
      "/ncurses/ncurses-examples.html">ncurses-examples</a>
      (whether separate or bundled with <a href=
      "/ncurses/ncurses.html">ncurses</a>) indirectly test terminal
      features, due to their reliance upon the line-drawing and
      character encoding support of the terminal.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><a href="/xterm/xterm.html">XTerm</a>'s sources include
      several scripts which demonstrate features that generally are
      outside the scope of vttest e.g., because they are specific
      to xterm rather than DEC terminals (see <a href=
      "https://github.com/ThomasDickey/xterm-snapshots/tree/master/vttests/">
      snapshot</a>).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>I have more than two thousand <a href=
      "/scripts/readme.html">scripts</a>, aside from those which
      are bundled with one of the programs I develop. Some of these
      scripts provide more in-depth testing of terminal
      capabilities. If a given script provides the only test for a
      feature, I generally move it into the collection bundled with
      xterm.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are tools which others have developed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href=
      "https://github.com/mattiase/wraptest"><em><code>wraptest</code></em></a>
      <em>&ndash; DEC VT terminal line-wrapping semantics</em>
      (Mattias Engdeg&aring;rd).</p>

      <p>Beyond its immediate usefulness, Engdeg&aring;rd pointed
      out a useful document which provides details on similar
      obscure features of DEC's terminals:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><a href=
        "http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/standards/EL-SM070-00_DEC_STD_070_Video_Systems_Reference_Manual_Dec91.pdf">
        <em>DEC STD 070 Video Systems Reference Manual</em></a>
        (EL-SM070-00, December 1991).</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><a href=
      "https://github.com/ThomasDickey/esctest2"><em><code>esctest</code></em></a>
      <em>&ndash; Automatic unit tests for terminal emulation</em>
      (George Nachman, <a href=
      "https://github.com/gnachman/esctest"><em>original
      site</em></a>).</p>

      <p>While vttest uses query/response control sequences to
      determine if the responses are valid, it relies upon (a
      knowledgeable) user to inspect test screens. Rather than
      inspect each test screen, this set of scripts uses the VT420
      DECRCRA control sequence to infer the contents of the screen
      at different points. It cannot test interactive features, and
      there are large areas (such as NRCS, C1, UTF-8) which are not
      yet covered (writing in August 2019), but within its intended
      scope is useful for regression testing.</p>
