NAME
       vttest - test VT100-type terminal

SYNOPSIS
       vttest [options] [24x80.132]

DESCRIPTION
       Vttest  is a program designed to test the functionality of a VT100 ter-
       minal (or emulator thereof).  It tests both  display  (escape  sequence
       handling) and keyboard.

       The program is menu-driven and contains full on-line operating instruc-
       tions.

       o   To run a given menu-item, you must enter its number.

       o   Menu items start at zero; this is the "Exit"  item  in  almost  all
           cases.

       o   You  can  run  all  menu-items  (for  a given level) by entering an
           asterisk, i.e, "*'.

       o   You can force a repaint of the menu items by entering "?".

       o   A few menus can be more than one page.  Use "n" and "p"  to  switch
           to the next or previous page.

OPTIONS
       You can specify the screen geometry in the form [24x80.132], i.e.,

       o   24 lines,

       o   80 minimum columns, and

       o   132 maximum columns.

       If  your  terminal  does  not switch between 80 and 132 columns you may
       specify 24x80.80, for example, to avoid a misleading display.

       Other options are:

       -V   print the program version, and exit.

       -f fontfile
            specify a file  containing  a  DRCS  (soft  character  definition)
            string.

       -l   log test results to vttest.log.

       -p   use padding, e.g., for a VT100 connected to a high-speed line.

       -s   add  time-delay  in  selected  panning/scrolling  options  to show
            details.

       -8   use 8-bit controls (this can be changed with a menu option).
