  <h2><a name="background" id="background">Background</a></h2>

  <p>I have been tracking my projects <a href=
  "/ded/cm_tools.html">using RCS</a> since the late 1980s. I
  <a href="/ded/sccs_tools.html">used SCCS</a> for a few years
  before then. Developers who use my programs are accustomed to
  using patches and tarballs to track changes to these files, using
  their own procedures.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there are other people who would like to
  casually browse the source history. Not all of them are
  developers.</p>

  <p>While I was working with XFree86, occasionally someone would
  ask where they could find a source-history for <a href=
  "/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a> and I would point to XFree86's CVS.
  I stopped committing to that in mid-2006. That finally became
  defunct in 2016 (ten years later).</p>

  <p>Providing my own CVS (or whatever) web-accessible respository
  would take away development time and be expensive. On rare
  occasions, someone else would offer to do some part of this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>in 2009, <a href=
    "https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554167">Jonathan
    Nieder</a> set up a git repository for <a href=
    "/mawk/mawk.html">mawk</a> on <a href=
    "http://git.debian.org/?p=collab-maint/mawk.git">Debian's
    server</a>, and discussed with me the possibility of getting my
    changes for mawk into git.</li>

    <li>in 2010, <a href=
    "https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-ncurses/2010-07/msg00021.html">
    Alejandro R. Sede&ntilde;o</a> set up a cron job which would
    collect my weekly ncurses patches, checking those into a git
    repository.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Git is a little more flexible than tar-balls:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>given a git-ball, it is relatively simple (compared to CVS)
    to make a web-accessible project, for browsing purposes.</li>

    <li>the same interface provides the ability to get a tar
    ball.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="problems" id="problems">Problems</a></h2>

  <p>Those were helpful, but did not complete the task. In the case
  of ncurses, those made web-accessible my weekly patches for
  ncurses starting with 5.6 (in 2006). During a given week, I make
  several changes, and the result is the weekly patch. Since most
  of the information would be omitted, I disregarded that.</p>

  <p>Mawk seemed more promising. However, I ran into a few
  problems:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Initially, I thought that I could replay my changes onto
      Neider's <a href=
      "https://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/jrnieder-guest/mawk-historical.git">
      initial git repository</a>. That effort used a few weeks
      finding that git's merge capability was not flexible enough
      to make a reliable/scriptable procedure.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Nieder had suggested <a href=
      "https://github.com/Oblomov/rcs-fast-export"><em><code>rcs-fast-export</code></em></a>
      as a tool.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>That script did not provide a complete solution, as I
      noted in <em>vile</em> <a href=
      "https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?28487">#28487</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>My RCS wrappers (like CVS) can be used for <em>lazy
      commits</em>, i.e., no lock is needed for a file. Unlike CVS,
      I use the file's actual modification time for the
      identifiers. On checkout, the wrappers <em>construct</em> the
      identifiers.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em><code>rcs-fast-export.rb</code></em> (a Ruby script)
      knows nothing about lazy commits. I modified the script to
      call my RCS wrappers to do the actual checkouts (which slows
      things down). If I were to replace those wrappers with
      additional scripting, another month or so would be needed to
      get the same resulting identifiers.</p>

      <p>In case someone questions why I want the identifiers,
      remind them that git uses its own identifiers, and if
      <em>those</em> were removed, git would not be useful.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The Ruby script uses a lot of memory, and was written for
      Ruby 1.9. Using it with Ruby 2.0 did not work well.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Different versions of git did not interoperate. Really.
      That's a step backward from RCS, where I can work with my
      archives on machines across a wide range of operating systems
      and versions.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The Ruby script writes directly to git's internal data
      structures. Those are undocumented.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The Ruby script handles only RCS archives with no
      branches. I use RCS branches in several of my projects.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Each export of my RCS archive using the script generates a
      new set of hash codes, making it impossible to transfer
      updates to an older export of the same archive.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Because of these problems, the Ruby script (while interesting)
  was not useful. I could not use it on the larger projects, even
  for one-shot uses such as I did for mawk:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href=
    "https://github.com/ThomasDickey/mawk-20101210b">mawk-20101210b</a></li>

  </ul>

  <h2><a name="solution" id="solution">Solution</a></h2>

  <p>In May 2016, <a href=
  "https://launchpad.net/~zosrothko">someone</a> commented that
  there were several forks from my <a href=
  "/byacc/byacc.html">byacc</a> tar-balls on github, and that was a
  problem. Actually, since none of the &ldquo;forks&rdquo; had been
  improved, there was little to discuss since there were no
  potential changes to merge back. In any case, I would merge into
  my RCS archives.</p>

  <p>But that prompted me to think about just (as in ncurses)
  constructing a git-ball with the <em>labeled</em> revisions from
  my RCS archives. As of mid-November 2016, I had (using <a href=
  "/scripts/readme.html#item:rcs2log">rcs2log</a>):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>18997 commits for ncurses on</li>

    <li>2805 days, with</li>

    <li>1145 labeled revisions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sede&ntilde;o's git repository has about half of those labeled
  revisions: 48% in mid-November 2016.</p>

  <p>I label things when I reach a milestone, whether or not that
  is when I decide to release a set of changes. By exporting the
  labeled revisions (rather than a complete archive), the result
  would still be useful, as well as being practical. But keep in
  mind that the number of labels is far smaller than the actual
  number of changes.</p>

  <p>In my revised approach, it is possible to do <em>incremental
  exports</em> from the archive onto a git-ball. Exporting all of
  the labels in the ncurses archive takes hours; exporting the
  latest revision takes a minute or so.</p>

  <h2><a name="process" id="process">Process</a></h2>

  <p>I wrote a script <a href=
  "/scripts/readme.html#item:release2git"><code>release2git</code></a>
  to do most of the work, and run that from a script
  <code>r2g</code> which knows how to manage the git-balls which I
  create and update. In some projects (such as <a href=
  "/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a>, the <code>MANIFEST</code> file is
  generated using the <a href=
  "/scripts/readme.html#item:manifest">manifest</a> script. That
  and other special cases are handled by
  <code>release2git</code>.</p>

  <p>Not all of my projects had labels. I wrote another script
  <a href=
  "/scripts/readme.html#item:tag-cutoff"><code>tag-cutoff</code></a>
  to label some of those using a cutoff-date. That worked for most,
  but not for the <a href=
  "https://github.com/ThomasDickey/pgf-vile-snapshots">older
  vi-like-emacs</a> archives which I received from Paul Fox in
  1996. I labeled that by writing a custom script (like
  <code>tag-cutoff</code>) and used that to label those files.</p>

  <p>I have generated git-balls for all of the projects which I
  share with others (as well as a few which I do not). You can see
  the result here:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=
    "https://github.com/ThomasDickey">https://github.com/ThomasDickey</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>While doing this, I realized that
  <em><code>rcs-fast-export.rb</code></em> would not be suitable,
  since using its approach none of the exported revisions would be
  signed. See the <a href=
  "https://github.com/ThomasDickey/pgf-vile-snapshots">pgf-vile-snapshots</a>
  repository versus the corresponding <a href="/archives/GIT/">fast
  export</a> for an example of this.</p>

  <p>Scripts are a different matter. Those all live in common
  directories, from which I generate the tar-balls that you can
  download from my <a href="/scripts/readme.html">scripts page</a>.
  I suppose that I could generate git-balls for those as well.</p>

  <p>When I release changes to one of my projects, I do this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>label it in RCS,</li>

    <li>run <code>r2g</code> to generate an updated git-ball (the
    old one is renamed, keeping a backup copy), and</li>

    <li>run <code>push2github</code> to update Github's copy of my
    git-ball.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The two steps use different keys, just in case.</p>

  <p>Just as a reminder: these are <a href=
  "http://searchdatabackup.techtarget.com/definition/storage-snapshot">
  <em><strong>snapshots</strong></em></a>. If someone wants to make
  a change, that will be done the same way as other projects, by
  first integrating into the RCS archives, and then exporting,
  updating the snapshots.</p>

  <h2><a name="others" id="others">Other stuff</a></h2>

  <p>In a few instances, I work on programs which are only in
  Git:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><a href=
      "https://github.com/ThomasDickey/esctest2">esctest</a>. This
      was written by George Nachman, originally bundled with
      iTerm2. He created a separate repository after incorporating
      my changes in <a href=
      "https://github.com/ThomasDickey/esctest2/commit/cbf6b88e95a70d3e304f365cec64174314841270">
      April 2018</a>. Nachman's version has been largely neglected
      after he switched from <a href=
      "https://github.com/gnachman/esctest">Github</a> to <a href=
      "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/esctest">GitLab</a>).</p>

      <p>Neither GitHub nor GitLab provides a way to maintain
      clones or forks from other sites. Some other developers
      mirror to both sites (as I could, since the repository that I
      actually use resides on my machines).</p>

      <p>Nachman chose not to do that, removing most of the files
      from the original. I renamed my repository to
      &ldquo;esctest<strong>2</strong>&rdquo; to avoid damage from
      an unintended pull from the original.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Xorg (freedesktop.org):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Xorg libraries which are used by <a href=
          "/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a>:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href=
            "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dickey/libx11">libX11</a></li>

            <li><a href=
            "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dickey/libxaw">libXaw</a></li>

            <li><a href=
            "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dickey/libxaw3d">libXaw3d</a></li>

            <li><a href=
            "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dickey/libxft">libXft</a></li>

            <li><a href=
            "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dickey/libxt">libXt</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Xorg applications which are related to those
          libraries:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href=
            "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dickey/twm">twm</a></li>

            <li><a href=
            "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dickey/xorgproto">xorgproto</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Xorg files started from a copy of XFree86 in November
      2003 (and were updated more than once during 2004 with
      additional copying from XFree86). All of those revisions were
      stored in CVS. The Xorg CVS was in turn imported into Git
      during <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/CvsPage/">2013</a>.
      Initially, that was hosted on <a href=
      "https://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/git/">freedesktop.org</a>,
      where the CVS repository was. As <a href=
      "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Infrastructure/git/">summarized</a>
      in the wiki, the Xorg developers moved that activity to
      GitLab in 2018 (but also provide a mirror on GitHub).</p>

      <p>Some of my changes, e.g., <a href=
      "/xterm/xtoolkit/xtoolkit.html">converting Xt to ANSI C</a>,
      had been incorporated, while others had not (such as my fixes
      for <a href=
      "/scripts/man2html.html#xfree86-rman"><em>rman</em></a>).
      While <em>rman</em> was no longer relevant (Xorg started
      using docbook in 2010), the work on the X libraries was not
      completed. I made improvements for that starting early in
      2019. In a sense, <em>rman</em> was still relevant, since the
      work by others to convert documentation to <em>docbook</em>
      was not completed, either.</p>

      <p>I cloned the Xorg libxt, and made changes to address both
      aspects</p>

      <ul>
        <li>modified libXt to work properly with
        <em><code>const</code></em> (making the FAQ <a href=
        "/xterm/xterm.faq.html#building_it"><em>How do I build
        XTerm?</em></a> obsolete), and</li>

        <li>updated the documentation (fixing numerous errors
        introduced by the docbook conversion). You can see the
        result <a href=
        "/xterm/xtoolkit/intrinsics.html">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In practice, updating a clone (using Git pull, merge, resolve,
  push) and applying changes back to the original repository (via a
  pull request) is just as much work as the process of exporting
  RCS to Git.</p>
