RESIZE(1)                       X Window System                      RESIZE(1)



NAME
       resize  - set environment and terminal settings to current xterm window
       size

SYNOPSIS
       resize [ -v | -u | -c ] [ -s [ row col ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Resize prints a shell command for setting the  appropriate  environment
       variables  to  indicate the current size of xterm window from which the
       command is run.

       Resize determines the command through several steps:

       o   first, it finds the name of the user's shell program.  It uses  the
           SHELL  variable  if  set,  otherwise  it  uses the user's data from
           /etc/passwd.

       o   then it decides whether to  use  Bourne  shell  syntax  or  C-Shell
           syntax.   It  uses  a  built-in table of known shells, which can be
           overridden by the -u and -c options.

       o   then resize asks the operating system for  the  terminal  settings.
           This is the same information which can be manipulated using stty.

       o   then   resize  asks  the  terminal  for  its  size  in  characters.
           Depending on whether  the  "-s  option  is  given,  resize  uses  a
           different escape sequence to ask for this information.

       o   at  this  point, resize attempts to update the terminal settings to
           reflect the terminal window's size in pixels:

           o   if the -s option is used, resize then asks the terminal for its
               size in pixels.

           o   otherwise, resize asks the operating system for the information
               and updates that after ensuring that  the  window's  dimensions
               are a multiple of the character height and width.

           o   in  either case, the updated terminal settings are done using a
               different system call than used for stty.

       o   then resize updates the terminal settings to  reflect  any  altered
           values  such  as  its  size  in  rows or columns.  This affects the
           values shown by stty.

       o   finally,  resize  generates  shell   commands   for   setting   the
           environment variables, and writes that to the standard output.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be used with resize:

       -c      This option indicates that C shell commands should be generated
               even if the user's current shell does not appear to use C shell
               syntax.

       -s [rows columns]
               This option indicates that Sun console escape sequences will be
               used instead of the VT100-style xterm escape  codes.   If  rows
               and  columns  are  given,  resize  will ask the xterm to resize
               itself using those values.

               Both of the escape sequences used for  this  option  (first  to
               obtain  the window size and second to modify it) are subject to
               xterm's allowWindowOps resource setting.   The  window  manager
               may also choose to disallow the change.

               The  VT100-style  escape  sequence used to determine the screen
               size always works for VT100-compatible terminals.  VT100s  have
               no corresponding way to modify the screensize.

       -u      This  option  indicates  that  Bourne  shell commands should be
               generated even if the user's current shell does not  appear  to
               use Bourne shell syntax.

       -v      This  causes  resize  to print a version number to the standard
               output, and then exit.

       Note that the Sun console escape sequences are  recognized  by  XFree86
       xterm  and  by dtterm.  The resize program may be installed as sunsize,
       which causes makes it assume the -s option.

       The rows and columns  arguments  must  appear  last;  though  they  are
       normally associated with the -s option, they are parsed separately.

ENVIRONMENT
       SHELL          Unless  overridden  by  the -c option, resize determines
                      the user's current shell by

                      o   first checking if $SHELL is set, and using that,

                      o   otherwise  resize  looks  in   the   password   file
                          (/etc/passwd).

                      Generally  Bourne-shell  variants (including ksh) do not
                      modify $SHELL, so  it  is  possible  for  resize  to  be
                      confused  if one runs resize from a Bourne shell spawned
                      from a C shell.

                      After determining the user's shell, resize   checks  the
                      shell's  name  against a table of known shell names.  If
                      it does not find the name in its table, resize will  use
                      C  shell  syntax  for  the  generated  commands  to  set
                      environment variables.

       TERM           Resize's generated shell command sets  this  to  "xterm-
                      new" if not already set.

       TERMCAP        Resize's  generated  shell command sets this variable on
                      systems using termcap, e.g., when resize is linked  with
                      the termcap library rather than a terminfo library.  The
                      latter does not provide the complete text for a  termcap
                      entry.

       COLUMNS, LINES Resize's generated shell command sets these variables on
                      systems using terminfo.   Many  applications  (including
                      the  curses  library)  use  those  variables when set to
                      override their screensize.

FILES
       /etc/termcap   for the base termcap entry to modify.

       ~/.cshrc       user's alias for the command.

EXAMPLES
       For resize's output to take effect, resize must either be evaluated  as
       part  of the command line (usually done with a shell alias or function)
       or else redirected to a file which can then be read  in.   From  the  C
       shell (usually known as /bin/csh), the following alias could be defined
       in the user's .cshrc:

           % alias rs 'set noglob; eval `resize`'

       After resizing the window, the user would type:

           % rs

       Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as  /bin/sh)  that
       don't  have  command  functions  will  need  to  send  the  output to a
       temporary file and then read it back in with the "." command:

           $ resize > /tmp/out
           $ . /tmp/out
