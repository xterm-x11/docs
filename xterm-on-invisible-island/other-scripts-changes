	* rcs2log: fix a missing chunk in wrapped lines

2022-07-12  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html:
	amend the hyphenation fix to account for href's pointing to a subdirectory.
	improve handling of hyphenated link by adding an option "-leftside" for
	the left-sides from hyphenated manpage names (with a short fallback for
	"apt", "cvs", "git", "sccs' and "sysv").

2022-07-09  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html:
	adapt Schilling's subsection change (suggested by Robert Clausecker)

	* man2html: fix the error which Schilling's diff introduced

2022-07-05  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html: source-in Schily's change, to test it
	the "lc" line produces a warning
	no change seen with ncurses manpages

2022-01-15  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* gnathtml:
	revert the fix for sorting, because it does not take submenus into account

	* gnathtml:
	fix a few validation errors reported by tidy, and lowercase the html

	* gnathtml: change the function-index logic to sort consistently

2022-01-09  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* rcs2log:
	fix a case in wrapping when the pending (unaccepted) word is long enough
	that it should force a new line, while the willfit (accepted) is empty.

	* rcs2log:
	add "-w" option, to wrap the list of files, because bulk-changes to testcases
	can make very long lines.

	* rcs2log: account for relative-path in "-p" option

	* rcs2log:
	add "-p" option, to allow showing permit-files but by default ignoring them

	* rcs2log:
	fix the easy shellcheck warnings (most of the remainder are false-positives)

2022-01-08  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* gnathtml: formatting cleanup

	* gnathtml: merge from branch - gnat's not in CVS anymore :-)

	* gnathtml:
	change usage-message to a here-document, to simplify formatting

	* gnathtml:
	turn on "use warnings", fixing 3 places where uninitialized variables were used

	* gnathtml: from gnathtml-8, filter out links for function parameters

	* gnathtml: from gnathtml-8, filter out links to generic formals

	* gnathtml:
	from gnathtml-8, filter out links for discriminants and references to the
	parent package (the latter affects one link in ncurses/Ada95)

	* gnathtml: remember to add copyright on my work...

	* gnathtml: fix an overlooked change for file-extension option

	* gnathtml: copy absolute option from gnathtml-8

	* gnathtml: copy file-extension option from gnathtml-8

	* gnathtml:
	indent with perl-tidy, and move use-strict to more conventional location

2021-02-08  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html:
	trim unwanted quotes from -title parameter which came from shellcheck fixes

2020-11-12  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* linklint: if I run
		linklint /foo.html
	it uses a different path, and breaks.  Repair by using a separate variable
	for the file-handle passed to ParseMap and ParseHtml

2020-08-19  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html:
	provide for a special case of subsections used in mawk-code.7, where some
	are only two-characters.

2020-01-25  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* rcs2log:
	use $RCS_DIR as in cm_tools to allow changing the name of the rcs subdirectory.
	This is needed to handle rcs-blame, since it has test-data including an
	"RCS" directory.

2019-10-14  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* linklint:
	headers are a valid target for href's since they can have "id" tags.

	* linklint: correct recent fix for undefined $url variable

2019-08-18  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* linklint:
	when requesting a link, make sure that spaces are URL-encoded, since a
	previous step undid that.

	* linklint: make output more repeatable by sorting hash-keys

	* linklint:
	running linklint showed more variables that were not imported - fixed.

	* linklint:
	with that (and enabling strict+warnings), there are a dozen warnings about
	a variable used only once.  Perl's not able to see that "*foo" in the
	incoming parameters from "$_" is the same as "%foo" used as "$foo{$bar}".
	quiet that warning using "once" pragma.

	* linklint:
	use "our" for the remaining variables reported by "use strict", and fix a
	reference to ASCII NUL

	* linklint: more use-strict issues

	* linklint:
	strict check pointed to an error in checking result from stat()

	* linklint: fix some use-strict issues

	* linklint:
	added "use diagnostics", which prompted quoting the "recursion" pragma

	* linklint:
	apply "use warnings", and fix references to undefined variables and ignore
	warning about deep recursion

2019-08-11  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* linklint: indent'd

	* linklint: minor whitespace cleanup

	* linklint: also allow id= in ul and blockquote tags

	* linklint: allow id= in pre's

2019-04-22  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* linklint: sort the list of files to make output more predictable

2018-01-01  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html: use https for website

2017-08-12  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* rcs2log: use SIGQUIT(3) rather than SIGTRAP(5) in trap commands
	This error dates back to 1997 (970802) in ncurses:
		+ many corrections to make progs/capconvert work, as well as make it
		  reasonably portable and integrated with ncurses 4.1 (reported by Dave
		  Furstenau <df@ravine.binary.net>).

	but I see in my "nfilter" script I used it as far back as December 1993, on the
	other hand in "externs" (August 1991) I had it corrrect.

	But here are the first uses in ncurses:
		capconvert	1997/08/02 21:52:06	1.3
		edit_cfg.sh	1997/11/08 18:14:57	1.7
		make_sed.sh     1997/12/06 20:52:47       tom
		MKterminfo.sh	1998/09/05 23:53:51	1.4
		MKtermsort.sh	2001/05/26 23:37:57	1.7
		MKkey_defs.sh   2001/06/16 15:25:10       tom
		MKkeys_list.sh  2001/06/16 16:47:39       tom
		make-tar.sh     2010/02/20 22:46:57       tom

2017-01-07  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html:
	better mapping for aliases by not modifying the displayed link-text.

2016-07-02  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* rcs2log:
	allow this to follow symbolic links to files as well as directories

2016-01-30  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html:
	if "-compress", suppress extra newline at the end of PRE-sections which added
	to whitespace on resulting page.

2015-07-08  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html: add "-toc" option, used in vile's documentation

2015-02-15  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html:
	make -title less obnoxious by using css "no-header" and omitting the following
	hr-tag from the h1-tag.

2015-02-14  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html: another fix for index-levels

	* man2html: corrected logic for index levels

2015-02-13  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html:
	add "-index" option, to move some functionality out of "fixup-man2html"

	* man2html:
	move the advert into the meta tag for "generator" as done with tidy.
	(verified that reformatting with tidy will not remove this tag)

	* man2html:
	modify heuristic for section-titles to allow it to match subsection titles
	(which differ only by their indent/margin value).

	* man2html: bump version

	* man2html:
	improve the fix to ensure there is no extra leading/trailing whitespace

2015-02-12  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html:
	fix special case seen in ctlseqs.ms where a partially bold line would be
	treated as a header.  The fix ensures that any non-punctuation/non-space
	character on the line is bold - the normal behavior for nroff.

2014-12-20  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html:
	Hood's old website is long gone; the replacement on Savannah had no updates
	(other than his change to use cvs).  Update the url to point to my site,
	which is the version I use for ncurses.

2014-01-06  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* linklint:
	lynx has a valid id attached to "em" in a dl - add relevant tags

2014-01-05  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* linklint:
	accept either "name" or "id" (let the validators worry about which are legal)

	* linklint: some obvious fixes:
		a) flush stderr/stdout, so I can pipe result inside vile
		b) change %20's back to spaces to check for actual files with spaces
		c) a-tags are not the only things that can have id's or name's for href

2013-12-21  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* man2html: sign my work.

	* man2html: for consistency, warn as I did for -externs

	* man2html: add "-aliases" option for ncurses

	* man2html: add "-externs" option for ncurses

	* man2html: stylistic - tell the number of params, for prototype

	* man2html: spelling :-)

	* man2html:
	isolated cause for uninitialized $fix variable which would be reported by
	"use diagnostics" or "use warnings" - ncurses output unchanged.

	* man2html: indented (with perltidy)

	* man2html: fix most of the warnings which come up with "use strict".
	However, turning on "use strict" will break ncurses' manhtml usage.

2013-05-18  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* gnathtml:
	specify charset's throughout, to help validate strict/transitional documents

	* gnathtml:
	upgrade the regular pages (which used font-color) to use css with html 4.01 strict

	* gnathtml:
	revert the doctype change - this is using font-color, which is valid for
	the transitional but not for the strict doctype.

2013-05-17  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* gnathtml:
	update doctype to use 4.01 strict, to fix quirks-mode warning from web developer tool

2010-08-29  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* xcutselprint: RCS_BASE

2010-08-28  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* altchars: 2010-05-02 version from ftp

	* altchars: reapply my fixes for ncurses

2008-01-23  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* linklint: RCS_BASE

2007-09-01  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* gnathtml: spelling

2006-09-17  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* altchars:
	I modified this to reflect stuff in ncurses - except for "|", since that
	doesn't seem to work as I'd like...

2006-04-03  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* unrpm: RCS_BASE

2005-05-14  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* gnathtml:
	changed all of the logic that generates or uses line/column references to
	use tag() function.  Once that was done (no problems noted), modified that
	function to prefix the tags with "ref_" to make them legal html id's.

	* gnathtml:
	fix a kludge which was putting an empty symbol out in output_symbol() by
	adding before_symbol() and after_symbol() to return strings that are used
	to bracket the actual symbol (which wasn't written using output_symbol()
	since it's already bracketed with a colored font and an href).

	* gnathtml:
	fix a place where the funcs.htm file was using a blank for the link (but
	that was incorrect since none of the functions begin with a blank)

	* gnathtml:
	fix a couple of places where </UL> was emitted when there was no <UL>

	* gnathtml:
	add doctype tag to each file (so I can run tidy and validate).
	change the NOFRAME to NOFRAMES in the frameset stuff (noting that it has
	a special doctype tag).

	* gnathtml: use strict (so I can check the script better)

	* gnathtml:
	keep the quoting fixes from 1.18.1.2, but omit the place where I tried
	to strip out references to empty symbols -- I think some of those references
	really are used.  Also trim blanks

	* gnathtml: add my 1.18.1.1 changes to 1.34

2004-09-29  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* altchars: RCS_BASE

2004-09-18  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* gnathtml: import from Debian

2003-04-26  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* rcs2log: hmm - the -R did have a shift.  leave the other fixes.

2003-04-25  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* rcs2log:
	it's obvious that no one used this script to support RCS files for some time...

	* rcs2log: RCS_BASE

2001-07-28  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* man2html: keep the version # the same.

	* man2html:
	add a fix to detect if the text used for an HREF was hyphenated, and add
	the missing chunk.

2000-06-17  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* gnathtml:
	oops: my comparison for $strips to an empty string was incorrect (matched
	a lot of nonempty strings).

2000-06-11  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* gnathtml:
	fix most places (one occurrence) where a blank or empty string was made an anchor.
	also, fix some quotes - wrong type

	* gnathtml: apply my 1.18.1 changes to 1.22

2000-06-10  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* gnathtml:
	fix most of the easy bugs - this didn't quote HREF=x or TARGET=x,
	was missing newlines at the ends of generated lines, and didn't even begin
	with <HTML>.

1999-09-24  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>

	* gnathtml: FROM_KEYS

1998-12-18  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@clark.net>
