  <h2><a name="synopsis" id="synopsis">Synopsis</a></h2>

  <p><code>lynx</code> is designed to be run either as a
  single-user application, or as a server, e.g., as a web portal
  accessed via telnet.</p>

  <h2><a name="highlights" id="highlights">Highlights</a></h2>

  <p>To allow it to be used as a server, it has configurable
  restrictions on the types of operations which can be performed by
  a user. In theory, <code>lynx</code> is secure.</p>

  <p>In practice, <code>lynx</code> suffers from its age: it was
  implemented largely in the mid 90's, by programmers who were not
  acquainted with modular/portable design. Repairing this is an
  interesting problem in maintainability (interesting to me at any
  rate). Since <code>lynx</code> does build and run on a wide
  variety of platforms, it cannot simply use two of the panaceas
  advocated by people who are familiar with the jargon of secure
  programming: <code>mkstemp</code> and <code>snprintf</code>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The first (<code>mkstemp</code>) is a BSD extension which
    is not for example present on Solaris. In some configurations,
    it is known to be insecure. The problem it solves (securely
    creating temporary files) is addressed a different way in
    <code>lynx</code>, i.e., creating temporary files within a
    secured directory.</li>

    <li>The other (<code>snprintf</code>) falls into a similar
    category: it is used to avoid buffer overflows arising from
    printf-like formatting. <code>Lynx</code> has its own
    <code>snprintf</code>-like code (actually two flavors: one
    appends to a buffer, which is not addressed by
    <code>snprintf</code> or the related asprintf). Like
    <code>mkstemp</code>, some implementations of
    <code>snprintf</code> and asprintf are known to be corrupt, so
    we do not use them.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Not all buffer manipulations fall readily into these
  categories; we review use of fixed-size buffers to ensure that
  they are being handled properly.</p>

  <h2><a name="discussion" id="discussion">Discussion</a></h2>

  <p>One problem with work in this area is that few people know
  much, but there is a lot of second-hand information. Second-hand
  information is frequently inaccurate.</p>

  <p>Many of the posters of exploits to BugTraq, for instance, are
  more concerned with being first to post than with the accuracy of
  their postings. Much of the traffic relating to
  <code>lynx</code>, in particular is ultimately due to a system
  administrator (in this case, read "computer operator") who
  apparently favors FreeBSD over Linux, and has made numerous (a
  few are accurate) disparaging remarks relating to security on
  Linux. We have addressed the items that are based on facts, but
  it appears that the main reason there are no current reports is
  that this loose cannon has evolved into a "security
  consultant".</p>

  <p>When preparing for <code>lynx</code> 2.8.3 (April 2000), I
  noted (after inspecting the related source code) that
  <code>lynx</code>'s competitors (<code>w3m</code> and
  <code>links</code>) suffered from the same sort of issues. See
  for example <a href=
  "http://archives.indenial.com/hypermail/bugtraq/2001/June2001/0282.html">
  w3m</a>. For some reason, <code>links</code> appears to be
  ignored by BugTraq, though it is not unusual for that application
  to dump core.</p>

  <p>In late 2001, I noted that while there there had been no
  security reports more recent than before lynx 2.8.3, common
  gossip continued that lynx is subject to multiple buffer
  overflows. (From 2009, that comment still holds; there are
  occasional issues to resolve, but "multiple buffer overflows" is
  nonfactual). It is in fact easier to fix the code than to stop
  the gossip. Report bugs if you find them. However, asserting in a
  BugTraq-style posting that one "could" cause a failure in a
  program is different from actually doing so.</p>

  <h2><a name="issues" id="issues">Issues</a></h2>

  <p>It used to be the case that security teams would notify the
  developer of flaws and get them involved. Perhaps some still do,
  but for others, the goal appears to be guided by the intent to
  publish the flaw first. Since they're generally unfamiliar with
  internals of larger programs, the published fixes tend to fall
  short of solving the problem.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-1085">This
  advisory</a> states "several vulnerabilities", though two are
  reported. Further, the patch (mostly code-cleanup) was one that I
  wrote, as inprogress development. However two organizations
  misattributed it to OpenBSD. Rather than checking with me to help
  with a minimal patch, they simply published it.</p>

  <p>In an <a href=
  "http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-876">earlier
  advisory</a>, I had responded to the report, and <a href=
  "http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lynx-dev/2005-10/threads.html">
  constructed a patch</a>. The security team issued a different
  patch, which did not actually solve the problem, as I noted
  <a href=
  "http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00922.html">here</a>.</p>
